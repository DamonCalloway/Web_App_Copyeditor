# eStyle Rules for PIB ELA Item Review

## a.m., p.m.&#8203;

  These abbreviations should be set in lowercase with periods. In order to avoid confusion, references to "12:00 a.m." and "12:00 p.m." should be expressed as "midnight" and "noon."

## abbreviations, acronyms and initialisms

  Typically, words and phrases are spelled out on first reference. If the acronym or initialism is not commonly used or would be confusing for the population being assessed, it may be included in parentheses immediately after the first reference. Some examples are shown below:

  - National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
  - Global Positioning System (GPS)
  - Computer-generated image (CGI)
  - Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
  - North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)

  Acronyms or initialisms may be used in titles, section headers, captions, art labels, graphics, and answer choices and for all subsequent references in text as long as the word or phrase is spelled out on the first reference in the main body of text.

  Certain common acronyms or initialisms may be used without spelling out on the first reference. Many of these will be listed as main entries with pronunciation (rather than as abbreviations) in the approved dictionary for the program (e.g., "DNA," "IQ," "JPEG," "laser," "scuba").

  When an indefinite article precedes an acronym or initialism, the choice of *a* or *an* is determined by the way the acronym or initialism is pronounced (e.g., "a UFO," "a NATO member," "a AAA battery").

## abbreviations, geographic references

  Do not abbreviate cities, states, countries, etc. unless necessary because of space restrictions.

  Traditionally, "United States" is spelled out as a noun and abbreviated ("US") as an adjective. However, it may be abbreviated as a noun if the meaning of "US" is clear from context.

## abbreviations, units of measure

 **ELA:** Spell out units of measure unless the assets are intended to test the ability to understand technical language. If so, follow the guidelines for math.

## according to vs. based on

  An accurate distinction should be made between "according to" and "based on." "According to" should be used when information is taken directly from a source. "Based on" is used when an inference must be made from a source. "Based on" is more commonly used in assessment because items typically require a student to make a cognitive leap.

## addresses

  In fictional contexts, streets, cities, and ZIP codes should always be fictitious but realistic (e.g., "1201 Oak Street, Appleton, TN 34028," not "1111 Main Street, Anytown, TN 00000").

## answer choices, because clauses

  In answer choices that give a short answer (e.g., a number, an expression or equation, or one word) followed by a rationale in the form of a "because" clause, a comma should precede the "because" clause since it is nonrestrictive. For example:

  - What is the length of the board? 4 feet, because 2 + 2 = 4
  - What is the tone of the passage? Nostalgia, because the narrator is remembering his childhood
  - Which organisms are secondary consumers in this ecosystem? Hawks, because they prey on rabbits
  - Should the writer delete this sentence? Yes, because it does not support the claim of the paragraph

## answer choices, capitalization

  In items with open-ended stems, the first word in each answer choice is lowercase (except for proper nouns and titles). The answer choices are treated as though they are a continuation of the stem.

  In items with closed stems, answer choices use sentence-style capitalization for both complete sentences and fragments.

  An exception is made for items with closed stems that ask for a word or phrase to replace a tested word or phrase in a passage. In this case, the word or phrase is capitalized so that it fits in the sentence in the position of the word or phrase being replaced.

## answer choices, end punctuation

  If the answer choices are complete sentences, including imperatives, include end punctuation. If the answer choices follow an open-ended stem to form a complete sentence, do not include end punctuation. If the answer choices are fragments that follow a closed stem, do not include end punctuation. Mixing complete-sentence and fragment answer choices is not recommended.

 **ELA:** End punctuation is not included when the answer choices consist of only part of a line of a poem.

## answer choices, option labels

 **Reading:**

  - K and G1 items DO NOT HAVE lettered options for any item type, and there are three options in every item.
  - G2 items DO NOT HAVE lettered options for standalone items but DO HAVE lettered options for items written to passages, and there are four options in every item.

## answer choices, order

 **ELA:** The preference is to order answer choices by increasing or decreasing length. Answer choices may also be ordered short, long, short, long as needed at Content's discretion.

  [Rules for math, science, and social studies omitted.]

 **All subjects:** In certain types of items, the following ordering guidelines override the ones listed above:

  - Answer choices that quote or reference text from a passage should be in the same order as the text appears in the passage, unless that cues the correct answer.
  - Answer choices that are taken from a graphical organizer in the stem should be in the same order as they appear in the stem.
  - Answer choices that list individual words or phrases from a passage should list those words or phrases in the same order as they appear in the passage.

## answer choices, paragraph numbers

  If the stem of an item asks "Which paragraph . . ." and the ACs consist of only paragraph references, use only the number without including "Paragraph" before it (e.g., "1" instead of "Paragraph 1").

  This does not apply to ACs that are multiple paragraphs (e.g., "Paragraphs 1 and 2").

## answer choices, paragraph references

 **Kindergarten–Grade 2:** Paragraph and line references are not added to the end of culled text in answer choices.

## answer choices, tested sentences

**Writing:** Avoid using tested sentences as answer choices in other items.

## apostrophes

  Apostrophes that are set in standard text will render as straight apostrophes. To create the preferred "curly" apostrophe, use the character picker.

  Apostrophes are typically used to form possessives or to represent elided characters such as in a contraction. They are not typically used to form plurals (e.g., "the Johnsons," not "the Johnson's"; "the 1990s," not "the 1990's"; "ABCs"). However, an apostrophe can be used to form the plural of lowercase letters or letters where adding an "-s" could cause a misread (e.g., "x's and y's," "A's").

## apps, operating systems, devices

  The names of apps, operating systems, and devices are set in roman without quotation marks. For capitalization, reflect the usage displayed by the software or device itself (e.g., "iPhone").

  For general reference, the term "app" is preferred over "application" for all programs that are delivered on computers and devices and that include a GUI (graphical user interface). Use the term "program" to refer to software that doesn't have a GUI.

## BC (BCE), AD (CE)

  These should be set in full capitals with no periods.

  Either "BC" and "AD" or "BCE" and "CE" are acceptable. However, the two styles should not be mixed in one asset (e.g., "BC" and "CE").

  Use "AD" or "CE" only if needed for clarification or to avoid confusion, such as when a time range extends from BC/BCE to AD/CE (e.g., "500 BC–AD 500").

  bulleted/numbered lists

  Using bulleted or numbered lists makes dense information more accessible to all readers. For example, bulleted lists can be used to organize information of equal importance, such as sets of facts, observations, or details. Numbered lists can be used to show order, such as the order of steps in a scientific investigation or a series of tasks.

  All entries in a vertical list should be parallel—either all fragments or all complete sentences. For improved readability, always use a complete sentence followed by a colon to introduce a vertical list.

  In bulleted lists, only complete sentences should have end punctuation and begin with a capital letter.

  In numbered lists, a period follows the numeral. Each entry begins with a capital letter, but only complete sentences should have end punctuation.

 **Note:** Predicates are not the same as imperatives, or commands, even though they may appear the same. Predicates are incomplete sentences, and therefore, they do not include end punctuation. For example, steps in a process or procedure do not have end punctuation.

## celestial objects

  The proper names of planets and other celestial, or astronomical, objects are capitalized. This includes references to planet "Earth" (no "the"). The scientific names for most celestial objects are not preceded by "the," but some common names, such as those for constellations, are (e.g., "the Milky Way," "Polaris" vs. "the North Star," "Ursa Major" vs. "the Great Bear").

  "The sun," "the solar system," and "the moon" are lowercased and include "the." Based on context, "the" may be replaced with a possessive noun or pronoun or an indefinite article (e.g., "Earth's moon," "our moon," "a moon").

  When "earth" or "the earth" is used to mean soil or referred to idiomatically, it is lowercased. "The" should be used as appropriate for the context.

  Examples:

  - These planets are ordered by their distance from the sun: Venus, Earth, Mars, Saturn.
  - She is floating in the saltiest natural body of water that can be found on Earth.
  - Where on Earth is the largest meteorite crater found?
  - Where on earth have you been hiding?
  - He turned the earth with his shovel.
  - We had to move heaven and earth.

## centuries

  Centuries are spelled out and lowercase (e.g., "eighth century," "twenty-first century").

## charts, tables, graphs

  Charts differ from tables by having no interior grid lines separating the unrelated data in the chart. Tables contain interior grid lines that separate the related data in the table. The distinction should be made appropriately.

**ELA, math, and social studies:** Titles are not required on all charts, tables, and graphs. The decision to use a title should be made based on the needs of the asset. If used, titles should be meaningful and provide a description of the presented data (e.g., "Marbles in a Bag," not "Data Table").

**Science:** All tables should include a meaningful title that is preceded by "Table," a number, and a colon (e.g., "Table 1: Masses of Five Samples"). Similarly, all other graphics, including charts, should have a meaningful title that is preceded by "Figure," a number, and a colon (e.g., "Figure 2: Life Cycle of a Butterfly").

  Multiple tables are numbered consecutively, starting at 1; multiple figures are also numbered consecutively, starting at 1. If there is only one table or figure in an item or a cluster, it is still numbered as 1.

  In the running text of the item or stimulus, tables and figures are referred to only by their label (e.g., "Table 1," "Figure 2"). The title is not included in the reference in running text.

## commas, introductory phrases

  Include a comma after an introductory participial phrase (e.g., "Excited by the news, the student began talking about the upcoming field trip").

  Include a comma after an introductory adverbial phrase if it contains a verbal element (e.g., "Before leaving, she grabbed her umbrella").

  Include a comma after an introductory infinitive phrase (e.g., "To score 100, you must get all answers correct").

  Include a comma after an introductory prepositional phrase, regardless of length (e.g., "In spring, there were yellow flowers").

  Include a comma to separate an introductory phrase that could be misread if combined with the noun following it. Some examples include the following:

  - Between proper nouns (e.g., "To Anthony, Blake remained an enigma")
  - Between numbers (e.g., "On May 20, 16 people were arrested")
  - Between proper nouns and numbers (e.g., "Last October, 31 students toured the state park")
  - In elided constructions (e.g., "Soon after, the party ended")
  - After a noun that can be misconstrued as an adjective (e.g., "At the school fair, students sold lemonade")

## commas, numerals

  Include a comma in a numeral with four or more digits, except in addresses, years, and ZIP codes. Also include a comma in a year with five or more digits (e.g., "10,000 BC").

  These guidelines apply to both cardinal and ordinal numbers.

## commas, personal names

  Commas should not be used to set off extensions in personal names, such as "Jr.," "Sr.," or "III." Nor should they be used to set off extensions in company names, such as "Inc." or "Ltd."

## commas, serial or Oxford

  For clarity, always include a serial, or Oxford, comma before the conjunction in a series (e.g., "steak, eggs, and toast").

## computer commands, key names

  Capitalize the proper names of commands and keys, even if the name of a key appears lowercase on a keyboard or if the name of a command or function appears lowercase on a screen. Lowercase generic terms and terms such as "key," "button," and "menu" if they follow proper names. For example, "Press the Enter key," "Use the Fewer or More buttons," "Page Setup," "function key F2," "Print Preview," "Cut," but "space bar," "toolbar."

  When referring to a punctuation key or a non-alphanumeric key in running text, spell out and capitalize the name of the key (e.g., "Alt-Shift-Hyphen," "Right Arrow key").

  Use hyphens between the keys that constitute a keyboard shortcut, or combination, when a user must hold down the first key or keys while pressing the last key (e.g., "Ctrl-Shift-End," "Ctrl-X"). Do not use a hyphen if each key is pressed separately in a sequence (e.g., "Alt F"). If using key graphics for a shortcut, use a plus sign (+) instead of a hyphen between key names.

  If ellipsis points appear after a command or a key name, such as a command that opens a drop-down menu or takes the user to additional choices, do not include the ellipsis points in references to the command (e.g., "The student selected New," not "The student selected New . . .").

  In reference to mousing, "click" does not require a following preposition (e.g., "Click Save," not "Click on Save"). "Dragging" implies that the user has clicked first. Specifying "click and drag" is redundant.

## Contractions

**Math, Science, and Social Studies:** Do not use contractions.

**Reading:** Do not use contractions in items unless they appear in text pulled from the passage. Contractions may be used in commissioned passages to accommodate the author's voice or to achieve a conversational tone. It is best to avoid contractions formed with "-'d," because "-'d" may represent "had" or "would," and contractions formed with "-'s," because "-'s" may represent "is" or "has."

**Writing:** Do not use contractions in items unless they appear in text pulled from the passage. Contractions may be used in commissioned passages to accommodate the author's voice or to achieve a conversational tone. However, do not use a contraction if the same contraction is being assessed elsewhere in the passage. It is best to avoid contractions formed with "-'d," because "-'d" may represent "had" or "would," and contractions formed with "-'s," because "-'s" may represent "is" or "has."

## court cases

  The names of court cases are italicized, including the "v." (e.g., "*Dred Scott v. Sandford*"). Do not italicize the date of court cases [e.g., "*Brown v. Board of Education* (1954)"].

## dates

  Dates are written in month-day-year order.

  When a date that includes the month, day, and year appears in the middle of a sentence, a comma should follow both the day and the year (e.g., "June 6, 1944, is D-Day.")

  When a date that includes only the month and year appears in the middle of a sentence, a comma is not included after the month or the year (e.g., "March 2000 was when . . .").

  When a date includes only the month and day, the day is expressed as a cardinal number, not an ordinal number (e.g., "May 6," not "May 6th").

  When a date includes only the day, the day is expressed as a spelled-out ordinal number (e.g., "the twenty-fifth").

## decades

  Decades may be spelled out or written as numerals with no apostrophe (e.g., "the sixties" or "the 1960s").

  To avoid ambiguity, repeat the century when an en dash is used to indicate a range of decades (e.g., "1950–1960").

## dictionary items

**ELA:**In items that test the meaning of a word by presenting a dictionary entry, the entry should be in a text box with the text box indented, using the indent button on the text editor interface.

  The tested word is boldface and lowercase unless it is a proper noun. The tested word is followed by its phonetic spelling in lightface (regular) font and enclosed in backslashes. Present the phonetic spelling as it appears in the approved dictionary for the program. If there are alternative pronunciations in the dictionary, use the first pronunciation.

  The part of speech is abbreviated without a period. It is set in lightface (regular) italics, and it precedes the number of the definition(s) it applies to. Multiple parts of speech may be presented (e.g. "n, adj").

  Definitions are numbered with a boldface number followed by a period. Definitions begin with a lowercase letter unless the first word is a proper noun. They do not include end punctuation. Definition text is lightface (regular).

  There are no hard returns in the text box. However, TEIs where entries are hotspotted should be formatted with hard returns between definitions.

## directions

  Each entry gives one or more direction lines that should be used for a specific interaction. Select the appropriate direction line for the condition that applies.

  Bracketed text in the direction lines may be customized to provide the following:

  - meaningful descriptions of genre
  - appropriate wording for the population being assessed
  - wording specific to the device/platform on which the assessment is administered

**ELA:**

  - Direction lines for parted items are placed at the top of the asset, on their own line.
  - Direction lines that ask the student to "read," "listen," or "watch" are placed at the top of the asset, on their own line.
  - All other types of direction lines are placed directly above the interaction, run in to the stem if appropriate.
  - For example, one item may have a stem and a direction line together on their own line and then an interaction, while another item may have a lead-in sentence on its own line, text pulled from the passage, a direction line on its own line, and then an interaction.

  Notes:

  - The assessment specialist may determine that a direction line is not necessary due to the context provided in the question.
  - The terms "answer" and "question" may be changed to more context-dependent words or phrases, as deemed necessary and appropriate by the assessment specialist.
  - **ELA:** Extended constructed response (ECR) items in ELA include boilerplate language consisting of a prompt and specific direction lines. See the "stems, ELA reading ECRs" and "stems, ELA writing ECRs" entries for more information.

## response interactions, choice

Choice is is a paper and online interaction that allows the test-taker to select a single response or multiple responses based on the item setup.

## response interactions, gap match

 The Gap Match interaction is a text-based drag-and-drop interaction that allows the test taker to drag words into one or more cloze blanks (gaps) within text. Online one choice can be placed in each gap.

## response interactions, gap match table

The Gap Match Table interaction is a text-based drag-and-drop interaction that allows the test taker to drag words into one or more cloze blanks (gaps) within a table. Only one choice can be placed in each gap.

## response interactions, graphic gap match

Graphic Gap Match interactions operate via code that differs from standard match interactions in that the items being used are not represented as standard text, but are images (graphics) instead.

## response interactions, hot spot

Hot Spot allows the test taker to select one or more areas called hot spots on an image.

## response interactions, hot text

Hot Text allows the test taker to select highlighted selections of text as choice options. Passage/stimulus text may be imported into the interaction. Text pending here.

Students receive this pop up if they attempt to select more than the max allowed: "You are permitted a maximum of XX choices for this question. Please unselect one of your choices before making another choice."

## response interactions, inline choice

Inline Choice allows the test taker to select a single text option from a drop-down menu within a table or inline text.

## response interactions, match

The Match interaction allows the test taker to drag image and/or text choices into labeled boxes called gaps.

## response interactions, match table grid

The Match Table Grid interaction allows test takers to select radio buttons or check checkboxes in cells to indicate a match between the column and row labels. Both the headers for the columns and the rows can contain either text or art, and each column can be set for single or multi-select. When the module is selected, a Corner Label, one Row, and two Columns will show.

## emphasis words, limiters

☝️ PIB now bolds *all* instances of "best" regardless of the "if more than one answer choice becomes correct" test below. All other limiting words are subject to the test.

Words that limit the answer choices to one correct answer should be emphasized. If more than one answer choice becomes correct if a limiter is removed, the limiter should be emphasized.

Some examples of limiting words include:

- best (*always* bold)
- fewest
- greatest
- least
- least likely
- likely
- main
- mainly
- most
- most likely
- mostly
- probably

## emphasis words, qualifiers

Qualifying words are modifiers that give a student important information about how to answer a question. If a student would be unable to demonstrate knowledge and skills if a qualifier is removed, the qualifier should be emphasized. Qualifiers are often used in multiple-select items (e.g.,"Select **three** correct answers").

Some examples of qualifiers include:

- all
- both
- each
- only
- one
- two
- three

 Not all instances of these words are emphasized. Emphasis treatment should be used only in the stem or charge itself, not in the scenario or setup of the item.

## emphasis words, reversal words

Words that reverse the typical intention or meaning of a stem should be emphasized in the stem. If a reversal word leads a student to select the exception to the answer choices, it should be emphasized. If the distractors become correct if the reversal word is removed, it should be emphasized.

  Some examples of reversal words include:

- cannot
- except
- never
- not
- opposite
- incorrect
- incorrectly

  Not all instances of these words are emphasized. Emphasis treatment should be used only in the stem or charge itself, not in the scenario or setup of the item.

## emphasis words, treatment

  All emphasis words are set in lowercase boldface font.

## en dashes

  An en dash is used to express a range of numbers. For ranges of numbers that include a unit of measure, if there is a space between the number and the unit, include the unit once following the second number (e.g., "50–75 m"). If there is no space, include the unit after each number (e.g., "75°F–105°F," "30%–50%").

  An en dash may also be used simply to represent the word "to," such as in scores or directions (e.g., "Our team beat Springfield, 13–6," "We took a London–New York flight").

  An en dash may also be used to replace a hyphen in a compound adjective when one element is an open compound (e.g., "post–World War II industry," "peanut butter–flavored candy").

  ELA: Ranges of only two paragraphs, sentences, lines, or stanzas should be separated by "and" (e.g., "sentences 15 and 16"). Ranges of more than two paragraphs, sentences, lines, or stanzas should be separated by an en dash, not "through" (e.g., "paragraphs 1–5").

## footnotes

  Footnotes may be used to provide definitions or translations of words or phrases (also called "glosses") or additional information. However, footnoting should occur only when a lack of understanding of a term would obscure the meaning of the asset as a whole. The skill of close, critical reading includes being able to glean meaning from text even when not all terms are understood. Footnotes appear at the bottom of the page, screen, or panel on which the footnoted word appears in the text.

  Text that requires a footnote should have a boldface superscript numeral directly following the footnoted text, with no space before the numeral. The superscript should be placed after any punctuation following the footnoted text, with some exceptions: (1) a dash, (2) a closing parenthesis if the footnoted text is only a subset of the parenthetical text, and (3) ellipsis points. Examples of superscript placement are shown below.

- "This looks suspicious,"<sup>1</sup> she said.
- There wasn't anything suspicious<sup>2</sup> about it.
- "If you don't want to look suspicious,<sup>3</sup> take off that mask," she pleaded.
- The whole thing seemed suspicious<sup>4</sup>—and why wouldn't it?—but I agreed anyway.
- (That also seemed suspicious.<sup>5</sup>)
- At this point, everything looked suspicious6. . . . And yet, no one seemed to notice.

  Footnotes should be numbered continuously throughout a passage. For example, if there is one footnote on the first page and two footnotes on the second page, the footnotes will be numbered 1–3. This is necessary to prevent confusion in any items referencing footnotes.

  The footnote itself should also begin with a boldface superscript numeral. There should be no space between the superscript and the text of the footnote. Footnotes may be written as a gloss (fragment or complete sentence) or as a complete sentence.

  If text requires a gloss, the glossed word or phrase is boldface and styled exactly as it appears in the passage. It is followed by a closed-up em dash and the definition or translation in lightface (regular) font. The gloss should match the part of speech of the glossed text in the passage. If the gloss is a fragment, it should not include sentence-style capitalization and end punctuation; if the gloss is a complete sentence, it should include sentence-style capitalization and end punctuation. If a footnote provides a translation of a foreign word, note the parent language in the gloss. Examples of glosses are shown below.

- <sup>1</sup>alluvial soil—soil deposited by water
- <sup>2</sup>mange tak—This Danish phrase means "thank you very much.
- <sup>3</sup> de jure—Latin for "by law"

  If text requires additional information, style the footnote as a complete sentence, such as the following:

- <sup>4</sup>Yuri Gagarin was a Russian cosmonaut and the first human to travel into space.
- <sup>5</sup>Hans Guck-in-die-Luft is a character from a German children's tale whose name means "Hans Head-in-the-Clouds." The character did not pay attention to what he was doing, so the term "Hans Guck-in-die-Luft" has become an affectionate way to refer to daydreamers and the absent-minded.

## foreign words and phrases

  Foreign words or phrases that have not been established as part of the English language should be set in italics. To determine whether a word or phrase is considered part of the English language, refer to the approved dictionary for the program. If the word or phrase appears in a list of foreign terms in the dictionary, this is an indication that it has not yet been established. If the word or phrase appears in the main body of the dictionary, it is considered established in the English language and should be set it in roman (plain) font.

  If a foreign word or phrase is repeated throughout a passage, it may be set in italics on first reference and then in roman (plain) font thereafter, at the discretion of the client or an assessment specialist. However, readability should always be taken into account.

## hypotheses, laws, postulates, properties, theorems, theories

  Set all words except proper nouns in lowercase (e.g., "additive identity property," "side-angle-side postulate," "Newton's first law," "the big bang theory," "Avogadro's hypothesis," "Pythagorean theorem").

## internal dialogue, thought

  ELA: In commissioned passages, place quotation marks around internal dialogue or thought (e.g., " 'You can't tell me what to do,' I thought, but I remained silent").

## labels

  A label is a descriptive, classifying, or identifying word or phrase. For the purposes of this entry, a label typically consists of two elements: a word or phrase describing the type of entity being labeled and a letter or number identifying the specific entity being labeled (e.g, "Student 1," "Location X," "Figure 1," "angle P").

  These types of labels are typically treated like proper nouns and capitalized as such. However, there are some exceptions that are common to the academic and assessment industries, as described below.

  Note that the pluralization of labels does not affect capitalization (e.g., "Figures 1, 2, and 3").

**ELA:** References to specific parts of passages are lowercase unless they appear at the beginning of a sentence (e.g.,  "paragraph 1," "line 19," "page 3," "sentence 4," "speech 5," "stanza 6," "scene 1," "act 2"). If a passage reference appears in the stem of an item, it does not need to be repeated in each answer choice.

## -like

  Hyphenate words formed by adding the suffix "-like" unless they appear as a closed compound in the approved dictionary for the program.

## literary present tense

**ELA:** In introductory paragraphs and items about narrative passages, use literary present tense (e.g., "What happens after Evan throws the discus the first time? His teacher asks him to throw it again").

  In introductory paragraphs and items about informational or narrative passages that refer to a historical event, use past tense (e.g., "Based on information presented in the story, the reader can infer that Civil War soldiers were motivated by —").

  In most items about authorial craft or the author's expression of his or her voice, use literary present tense (e.g., "The author begins the article . . ."; "The author includes sensory language in paragraph 11 . . ."; "Why does the author use short sentences in the last stanza . . . ?"). However, use past tense when referring to things about the author that occurred in the past, including the physical action of writing (e.g., "The author wrote this selection most likely to —"; "The author moved to Vermont in 1990 because . . ."; "Why was the author afraid to dive into the pool?").

## money

  In references to currency (paper or coin), consistency in appearance overrides other rules. Two or more amounts that appear in the same context should be styled the same, with the style being determined by the following rules:

  If the number is spelled out, spell out the currency as well; if the number is written in numerals, use a currency symbol (e.g., "five dollars" or "$5," not "5 dollars").

  Whole amounts written in numerals should include zeros and a decimal point only when they appear in the same context as fractional amounts (e.g., "$20, $21," but "$20.00, $20.50").

  Whole amounts of a million or more may be written in a mixture of numerals and spelled-out numbers (e.g., "$12 million"). However, if they appear in the same context as whole amounts of less than a million, use a consistent style (e.g., "$500,000 and $12,000,000").

  [Rules for math omitted.]

**Writing:** If the spelling or capitalization of a number or currency is being tested, spell out the tested word.

## numbers, decimals

  Nonzero decimal values between –1 and 1 should take a leading zero (e.g., "0.5," "–0.01"). The leading zero is also included in some decimal quantities that must be 1.00 or less, such as probabilities and correlation coefficients (e.g., "p ‹ 0.05"). However, it is omitted in baseball batting averages and firearm calibers (e.g., "a .22-caliber rifle").

## numbers, fractions

  ELA, Science, and Social Studies: Fractions should be spelled out and hyphenated (e.g., "one-third," "three-fourths," "three and one-half"). For parallel construction in certain idiomatic uses, do not hyphenate a fraction expressed as a noun (e.g., "one half . . . the other half").

## numbers, ordinals

  Do not use a superscript when writing ordinals (e.g., "4th," not "4th").

## numbers, ratios

  A ratio can be written as a fraction, with a colon, or with the word to (e.g., "a 3-to-1 ratio"). Write all ratios in the same format throughout an item unless ratio style is being assessed. Ratios written with a colon are set with no spaces surrounding the colon (e.g., "2:4").

## numbers, spelled out

  In nontechnical context, spell out whole numbers from zero through nine. Use numerals for all other numbers.

  Numbers that are used in calculation or appear in lists, tables, or graphs should be presented as numerals.

  Numbers that are part of a label should be presented as numerals (e.g., "Day 1," "paragraph 9"). (Note: There are some exceptions when referencing stanzas. See Language > passage/stimulus references.)

  Do not start a sentence with a numeral. Recast the sentence or spell out the numeral.
  If multiple numbers appear in the same paragraph or item and are used in a similar way, make them consistent. If one must be a numeral, make them all numerals. If they are used in different ways (e.g., one number used for calculation and another used idiomatically), they may be inconsistent.

  When two numbers appear together, spell out the first one and use a numeral for the second one (e.g., "two 12-foot pythons"). But if the first of two numbers is a one, do not include it (e.g., "an 8-inch piece of string," not "one 8-inch piece of string").

  Because of the possibility that zero could be confused with the letter O, spell out zero if it appears alone in text, without a unit of measure and not part of an expression, equation, or inequality.

  These guidelines apply to both cardinal and ordinal numbers. They also apply to numbers that are used to indicate measurements of physical quantities, such as distance, length, area, volume, mass, and pressure, unless the measurement is commonly expressed in numerals (e.g., "a 40-watt bulb," "a size 14 dress," "40 miles per gallon").

  See amendments and centuries for exceptions.

## numbers, telephone numbers

  If a fictitious phone number is needed for a passage, one should be provided by the client or Pearson. "555" telephone numbers are no longer safe options.

## OK/okay/O.K.&#8203;

  Use "OK," not "okay" or "O.K." (except in permissioned passages or

  quotations of previously published text).

## parted items (EBSRs)

  Parted items, or evidence-based selected response (EBSR) items, typically have a Part A and a Part B. For direction lines, see the entry in the Links section below.

**ELA/Reading only:**

  In Part B stems, Part A is typically referenced within the stem. Note that the passage title is typically not repeated in Part B, even for items written to paired passages. Exceptions may be made when an item written to one stimulus in a pair needs the title of the stimulus included in the stem to ensure no confusion on the part of the reader. For example, if Part B options are paragraph numbers, including the title of the stimulus in the stem would remind students which passage the paragraphs are from.

  NOTE: For items with more than one correct answer in Part B, another direction line is

  included in the Part B stem (run in, not on its own line). See examples below.

  NOTE: These guidelines apply primarily to parted items that are multiple choice/multiple choice or multiple choice/multi-select. Parted items with a TEI (e.g., a match table grid) will use di􀆯erent direction lines depending upon the interaction.

**Part B Stem Examples:**

- Item written to a singleton passage with only one correct answer in Part B: "Which [sentence/detail/evidence/phrase] from the [genre description, e.g., story/poem/play] **best** supports the answer to Part A?"
- Item written to a singleton passage with more than one correct answer in Part B: "Which [sentences/details/evidence/phrases] from the [genre description, e.g., article/story/poem/play] **best** support the answer to Part A? Select **two** correct answers." Note: if "evidence" is used, "support" should be "supports" for proper agreement.
- For an item written to only one passage in a paired passage with more than one correct answer in Part B: "Which [sentences/details/evidence/phrases] from the [genre description, e.g., article/poem/story, etc.] **best** support the answer to Part A? Select **two** correct answers." Note: if "evidence" is used, "support" should be "supports" for proper agreement.
- For a paired passage with more than one correct answer in Part B when the CAs are from different texts: "Which [sentences/details/evidence/phrases] from the [genre description, e.g., articles/article and poem/story and play, etc.] best support the answer to Part A? Select one answer from each [genre description, e.g., article/story/poem, etc. (use "passage" here if the genres are different)] for a total of two correct answers." Note: if "evidence" is used, "support" should be "supports" for proper agreement.
- Which details from the story and the poem **best** support the answer to Part A? Select one answer from **each** passage for a total of **two** correct answers.
- Which evidence from the articles best supports the answer to Part A? Select one answer from **each** article for a total of **two** correct answers.

## passage/stimulus references

  When referring to a passage or stimulus **without using the title**, use language that provides a meaningful description of the selection—regardless of whether the selection is an excerpt or a complete work—such as "article," "poem," "story," "passage," "personal essay," "play," "video," etc.

 **Exceptions:** For excerpts from NF books, use "passage" in grades 3–5. For excerpts from fiction *books*, use "story" in grades 3–8 and "passage" in HS.

  When referring to a passage or stimulus **by title**, apply standard styling. For detailed guidelines on styling titles, see *The Chicago Manual of Style*.

  When referring to **a passage that is an excerpt of a larger work by title**, include the phrase "the excerpt from" before the correctly styled title. Note that "the excerpt from" should be omitted in a parenthetical citation for the sake of brevity [e.g., "(paragraph 3, *Book Title*)" rather than "(paragraph 3, excerpt from *Book Title*)"].

  When referring to an **excerpt** from a passage or stimulus while including the title, use a combination of descriptive language (to best describe the nature of the excerpt) and a correctly styled title. Some examples of conventions are shown below.

  Some examples of these conventions are shown below.

  • in paragraph 1 of the story
  • in paragraph 32 of the play
  • the excerpt from B*ook Title*
  • in "Section Heading" from "Article Title"
  • in line 10 of "Poem Title"
  • the scene from the excerpt from *Play Title*
  • the excerpt from *Play Title*
  • the excerpt from "Short Story Title"
  • a reading of an excerpt from *Book Title*

  When referencing a stanza from a poem, use a numeral unless referencing the first or last stanza in the poem, in which case use "first stanza" or "last stanza." When referencing multiple stanzas, always use numerals (e.g., "In stanzas 1–3, . . ." or "In stanzas 1 and 2, . . .").

  When referencing parts of a play, use the word "paragraph" instead of "line" or "speech."

**Kindergarten to Grade 2:** If the passage is an excerpt, use the title in the items, rather than a general term or "excerpt from." If the passage is from a book, use quotation marks around the title in the items, rather than italics.

**Stand-Alone Items:**

- For literary stand-alone items: Preference is to use "paragraph." However, if the stimulus reads like a story/fable and/or the stimulus is multi-paragraphs, "story" can be used. "Passage" is NOT used.
- For informational stand-alone items: Use "paragraph." "Passage" is NOT used.

**Exception:** The stems for hot text stand-alone items do NOT reference the stimulus (i.e., "Which details support . . . ," not "Which details from the paragraph support . . .").

  When referencing a section heading from a passage, include quotation marks around the section heading when it appears in running text (i.e., a stem, an inline-choice sentence, a drop-down, or an answer choice sentence or phrase). When the section heading is the answer choice, table header, or column entry, no quotation marks are needed.

## percent, percentage

  In nontechnical context, spell out the word "percent." In technical context, use the percentsymbol (%).

  "Percent" is an adverb and follows a number; "percentage" is a noun and does not follow anumber (e.g., "Less than 1 percent is a very small percentage").

## personal names, children vs. adults

  In nonfiction commissioned passages and nonfiction item scenarios, refer to people bytheir full name on first reference. On subsequent references, refer to adults by their lastname and children under 18 by their first name. In commissioned passages, using the fullname on the first reference in the concluding paragraph is also acceptable. The full name may also be used in titles, captions, and graphics, as determined by space restrictions, thetone of the passage, and/or the needs of the asset.

  Exceptions to these guidelines may be needed in order to differentiate between characters with the same last name or to refer to a character who is described at different ages in an asset.

## personal names, initials

  Typically, each initial in a person's name should be followed by a period and one space(e.g., "George H. W. Bush"). However, if a person styles his or her name di􀆯erently, use thestyle that person prefers (e.g., "Malcolm X"). If the entire name is abbreviated as initials,omit the periods and spaces (e.g., "FDR").

## personal names, social titles

  In nonfiction commissioned passages and nonfiction item scenarios, social titles, orhonorifics, should not be used (e.g., "Mr.," "Mrs."). If two people with the same last nameare referenced, use full names or other descriptive language to differentiate them (e.g.,"Smith and her husband" if Smith is the focus of the passage).

  "Dr." should be used to refer only to medical doctors, not to those who have a doctoraldegree. If it is necessary to establish a person's credentials, descriptive language oftenprovides more information than a social title (e.g., "Alan Turing, an English computerscientist and mathematician"). Even for medical doctors, "Dr." should be omitted in favorof descriptive language (e.g., "my cardiologist, Amanda Green").

  In fictional passages, if a social title is used to refer to an unmarried woman or a girl, use"Ms." for adults and "Miss" for children under 18.

## pop-up glosses

  For online assessments, pop-up glosses may be used instead of footnotes to presentglosses of words or phrases. The gloss tags should not include any punctuation followingthe glossed text.

  See the "footnotes" entry for more information about how to style a gloss. Note that thedefinition for a pop-up gloss does not need to include the glossed word or phrase or an em dash.

## quotation marks

  Quotation marks that are set in standard text will render as straight quotation marks. To create the preferred "smart," or "curly," quotation marks, use the character picker. This applies to both single and double quotation marks.

  Insert a space between consecutive single and double quotation marks.

## racial/ethnic terms

  Be as precise as possible when referring to racial or ethnic identity (e.g., "German settlers,"not "European settlers" or "white settlers"; "the Caddo," not "American Indians";"Peruvian" or "Puerto Rican," not "Hispanic" or "Latino").

  Capitalize "Black," "Brown," and "Indigenous" and lowercase "white" when referring toracial or ethnic identity by these broad terms. "Black" and "Indigenous" are capitalized toacknowledge that these racial/ethnic groups have a shared experience in the Americas thattranscends specific cultures and includes numerous generations. If "Black," "Brown," or "Indigenous" appear lowercased in previously published text (permissioned or publicdomain), notify the permissions coordinator assigned to the program, who will confirmwhether it is permissible to uppercase the term.

  When using broad terms, use "Black" instead of "African American" except in somehistorical contexts (see below). Avoid using "Brown" unless necessary for context (e.g.,when quoting original text or referencing a political cartoon that uses this term). Use amore precise term if possible. Avoid using these terms as nouns (e.g., "Black people," not "Blacks") unless quoting original text or in the case of the historical term "free Blacks."

  Note, however, that racial terms in previously published text should not, in general, bechanged (e.g., do not update "African American" to "Black"). Use of original terms is oftennecessary in order to achieve authenticity and factual accuracy in social studies and in ELApassages that discuss history. However, some outdated terms may be consideredinappropriate for lower grade levels or o􀆯ensive (e.g., "colored," "Negro," "mulatto"). If apotentially inappropriate or offensive term appears in previously published text, it may bepossible to redact the term and/or replace it with another term in brackets. Notify the permissions coordinator assigned to the program, who will confirm whether redactionand/or replacement is permissible.

  Depending on context, audience, and grade level, it may be appropriate to use more up-to-date terms in answer choices that reference historical texts with outdated terms. These word choices should be made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of an assessment specialist.

  Bryan Garner, author of *Garner's Modern English Usage*, provides further context on the styling of "Black" vs. "white":

  > In June 2020, the *AP Stylebook* changed its policy to favor capitalizing *Black* whenever theword is used in a racial, ethnic, or cultural sense. Meanwhile, white would be lowercase even in corresponding senses. The change occurred after years of consideration and close study.
  >
  > Here's the reasoning. Most white people in North America can and do identify themselves as Irish, Scottish, English, French, German, Scandinavian, Italian, etc. The only people who think of a generic "white identity" tend to be white supremacists, who routinely capitalize the word white.
  >
  > Black people, however, cannot identify themselves as descending from the people of Gambia, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Sierra Leone, etc. Part of the centuries-long slave tradeinvolved forcibly stripping Black people of their original cultures—their traditions, their customs, their languages, and their beliefs. When African people were violently uprootedfrom their ethnically diverse continent, their heritage was purposely and systematically obliterated.
  >
  > So capitalizing Black merely recognizes that their descendants in the Americas have a shared experience—a certain commonality that transcends any particular African cultureand includes all that has happened for many generations.

## singular "they"

  Generally, avoid the use of the singular they and the gender-neutral *they*. The singular they refers to the use of the plural pronoun they or its derivative forms (*them*, *their*, *theirs*, *themselves*, *themself*) to refer to a singular subject. It is often used ininformal language when the gender of the subject is unknown.

  The gender-neutral *they*, on the other hand, refers to the use of the plural pronoun and its derivative forms to refer to a person who identifies as nonbinary (for example, "Elliot Page changed their name from Ellen Page″). Do not use the gender-neutral *they* for fictional named actors in math items or for fictional characters in commissioned fictional reading or writing passages. However, the gender-neutral *they* is acceptable in permissioned passages. It is also acceptable in commissioned informational passages about a realperson who prefers these pronouns, but generally, it is best to recast the sentence to avoid pronouns if possible.

  The use of the singular *they* and the gender-neutral *they* can often be avoided by recasting the sentence, as shown in the examples below. Some of these methods involve eliminating pronouns altogether or recasting complex sentences into simple constructions, which canhave added benefits for English language learners or struggling readers. One fix to avoid, if possible, is using pronoun alternative phrases such as *he* or *she*, which can make the writing wordy and stilted.

**Examples of recasting:**

- Delete the pronoun reference altogether.

**Avoid:** Every student should do the reading as soon as it is assigned to them.

**Change to:** Every student should do the reading as soon as it is assigned.

- Change the pronoun to an article, such as *a* or *the*.

**Avoid:** Have the student describe their favorite meal.

**Change to:** Have the student describe a favorite meal.

- Pluralize the subject so that the pronoun becomes correct.

**Avoid:** A student added sugar to a beaker of water and stirred the mixture. Which change did they**most likely** observe?

**Change to:** Some students added sugar to a beaker of water and stirred the mixture.

- Which change did they most likely observe?

**Avoid:** Sometimes a person needs someone to encourage them.

**Change to:** Sometimes people need someone to encourage them.

- Use the relative pronoun *who*, especially when the singular *they* follows an *if*.

**Avoid:** If a person doesn't work hard, they won't feel a sense of accomplishment.

**Change to:** A person who doesn't work hard won't feel a sense of accomplishment.

  • Repeat the noun instead of using a pronoun, especially when the two are separatedby several words or a graphic.

**Avoid:** A student made observations of some organisms and then drew a food web. [ART] Based on their observations, what will most likely happen if the population of secondary consumers is reduced?

**Change to:** A student made observations of some organisms and then drew a food web.

  [ART] Based on the student's observations, what will most likely happen if the populationof secondary consumers is reduced?

## stems, actors

**ELA:** In stems, if a third-person point-of-view impersonal reference to the reader is used, prefer "the reader" singular to "readers" plural.

## stems, directional language

  In order to accommodate delivery on various platforms, avoid directional language when referencing elements in stems (e.g., "above," "below") except when necessary to differentiate between multiple elements.

## stems, ELA reading ECRs, G3-G5

  Extended constructed response (ECR) items that use the Extended Text interaction include a boxed prompt and boilerplate directions. Bracketed text in the samples below may be customized for each item. All other text as well as the formatting should be recreated as shown, although minor variations in word choice are acceptable at Content's discretion.

## stems, ELA writing ECRs

**ELA:** Extended constructed response (ECR) items that use the Extended Text interaction include a boxed prompt and boilerplate directions. The boilerplates below are for ECRs associated with a passage alone (and no reading items). Bracketed text and parenthetical word alternatives should be customized asneeded. The formatting and all other text must be recreated exactly as shown.

  For example, the first sentence of an ECR associated with a short story from Cricket magazine would be styled with this convention: "Read 'Horses Are Awesome.' " The first sentence of an ECR associated with apair of passages consisting of an excerpt from a book and a personal essay would be styled with thisconvention: "Read the excerpt from *My Friend Flicka* and 'My Sweet Kitty.' "

## stems, open-ended

  Unlike closed stems and charge statements, which are complete sentences with end punctuation, open-ended stems are incomplete sentences. The answer choices complete the sentence.

  Open-ended stems end in an em dash preceded by a space (e.g., "The author wrote this passage most likely to —").

## stems, what/which of these/which of the following

  "What" should be used in a stem when there is only one correct answer in the universe; "which" should be used when there may be multiple correct answers but the student must choose from only the answer choices presented.

  A noun should always follow "Which." The noun should provide a meaningful description of the answer choices, if possible (e.g., "Which statement provides the best evidence...," "Which expression can be used to find . . .," not "Which answer . . ."). "Of these" is unnecessary unless it improves the readability of the stem (e.g., "Which table...," not "Which of these tables . . .").

  If there is no noun that can be used to represent the answer choices, "Which of these" is an acceptable alternative.

  "Which of the following [nouns]" or "Which of the following" should be used only when it is necessary to point the student to answer choices below the stem (e.g., "Sally saw this animal at the zoo. [ART] Which of the following animals has a similar body structure? [ART choices]").

## taxonomy, binomial nomenclature

  Genus and species names are both italicized. The genus name is capitalized; the species name is lowercase (e.g., "*Rosa caroliniana*," "*Styrax californica*," "*N. natrix* "). The genus name may be presented as an initial.

  The names of higher levels of taxa (families, orders, classes, phyla, kingdoms, domains) are not italicized. The words "family," "order," "class," "phylum," "kingdom," and "domain" are lowercase before or after the name of a taxon (e.g., "the kingdom Animalia" or "the Eukarya domain").

## temperatures

  The unit of measure (e.g., Fahrenheit, Celsius, kelvins) should be specified for clarity.

  For temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius, do not include a space between the degree symbol and the "F" or "C" [e.g., "15°C," "Temperature (°F)"]. "Degrees Fahrenheit" and "degrees Celsius" are each a phrase that represents a single unit of measure, so either abbreviate or spell out the whole unit (e.g., "15°C" or "15 degrees Celsius," not "15° Celsius").

  For temperatures in kelvins, do not include a degree symbol. Include a space between the number and the unit of measure (e.g., "200 K").

## tested words/phrases

**ELA:** In passage-based items, tested words and phrases should be underlined and have the same capitalization as they do in the passage, both in the stem and in quotations set off from the stem. Tested words and phrases should not be underlined in passages.

  In stand-alone items, tested words and phrases should be underlined everywhere they appear in the item and have the same capitalization in the stem as they do in the boxed stimulus.

  Note that it is sufficient to set off a tested word or phrase in a stem with only an underline. Quotation marks are not needed.

  Note that if a tested word is part of a dictionary or thesaurus entry, the word is lowercase and bold in the entry and underlined elsewhere in the stem.

## text in art, charts/tables/graphs

  Titles are always set with headline-style capitalization.

  Table and chart column headers and graph axis headers are set with headline-style capitalization. Exception: If a table header is a full sentence (e.g., a theme), it should be set with sentence-style capitalization.

  Units of measure that appear in parentheses are lowercase unless they are always capitalized [e.g., "(inches)," "(ºC)"].

  All other text—such as column and axis subheads, text in cells, and bar labels—is set with sentence-style capitalization. Complete sentences include end punctuation, but fragments do not.

## text in art, graphics

  Titles are always set with headline-style capitalization, including drop-bay titles (unless the drop-bay title includes a tested word or phrase, which is styled as it appears in the passage).

  Text that appears in graphics may be fragments or complete sentences. Both fragments and complete sentences use sentence-style capitalization. Complete sentences include end punctuation, but fragments do not.

  Some examples of graphics that may include interior text include:

- Circle graphs
- Diagrams
- Draggers
- Food chains
- Food webs
- Graphic organizers
- Map labels
- Pointers that identify aspects of a photograph or line art
- Spinners
- Time lines
- Venn diagrams

  Note: For accessibility reasons, colors in art should not be referenced in stems. If there is a need to identify a colored element of a piece of art, a label should be applied so that the element may be referenced by name.

## text in art, photographs/line art

  Titles are always set with headline-style capitalization.

  Captions appear under a piece of art and provide an explanation of the art or further information related to the art. They should not be confused with titles, which appear over a piece of art and serve as an identifier of the art. Captions may be fragments or complete sentences. Both fragments and complete sentences use sentence-style capitalization. Complete sentences include end punctuation, but fragments do not.

  Other identifier labels that appear under a piece art are styled in the same way as captions (e.g. "Figure 1," "Top view").

## text in bays/gaps

  If titles appear in drop bays, or gaps, the titles that are fragments are set with headline-style capitalization and do not include end punctuation. Drop bay, or gap, titles that are complete sentences are set with sentence-style capitalization and end punctuation.

## text in draggers

**Grade 3–High School**:

  The capitalization of text in draggers depends on the interaction type used for a drag-and-drop item.

- **Gap Match:** Dragger text is set with sentence-style capitalization. However, the text of a dragger that is dropped into a sentence or a paragraph is set with the appropriate capitalization based on where the dragger falls in the completed sentence.

- **Match:** Dragger text is set with sentence-style capitalization.

- **Order:** Dragger text is set with sentence-style capitalization.

- **Gap Match - Table:** See the entry ""text in art, charts/tables/graphs" (linked below) for guidelines on styling any text that is dropped into a table.

- **Graphic Gap Match:** Draggers are set as art. See the entry ""text in art, graphics" (linked below) for guidelines on styling any text that is included in dragger art.

  Text is centered within the dragger. Complete sentences have end punctuation; fragments do not.

  If draggers are grouped into categories, or starting groups, with titles, titles that are fragments are set with headline-style capitalization and do not include end punctuation. Starting-group titles that are complete sentences are set with sentence-style capitalization and end punctuation.

**Kindergarten–Grade 2**:

  The draggers in passage-based items follow the rules above.

  The words or phrases in draggers in stand-alone items should be lowercase.

  Single letters in draggers in stand-alone items can be either capped or lowercased. However, the whole item should be consistently one or the other.

## text-support items

  In text-support, or text-evidence, items, text that is pulled from the passage should be quoted exactly,although ellipses may be used to represent omitted text. All special formatting in passage text (italics,boldface, underscores, etc.) is retained when quoting text in items.

**QUOTED TEXT IN STEMS**:

- In stems, quotations in running text are enclosed in quotation marks (e.g., "What did the narrator meanwhen she said that the cat was 'indifferent but delightful'?"). When quoting lines from a poem in running text, separate lines from the poem with a slash with a space on either side (e.g., "Hiding in thewoods / By day / By night").
- Quotations set on their own line and not within running text are enclosed in a text box and formatted to match the passage. Only text that is in quotation marks in the passage should appear in quotationmarks in a text box. Ellipses should be used to indicate omitted text in the middle of a quotation using the same guidelines applied to ellipses in quoted text in answer choices.
- If sentences from different, nonconsecutive paragraphs are quoted in a text box, include aparenthetical paragraph reference after each sentence.

**Example**:

  This is quoted sentence 1. (paragraph 3)

  This is quoted sentence 2. (paragraph 6)

**REFERENCES IN STEMS TO QUOTED TEXT IN OPTIONS**:

- Stems should specify that answer options are from the passage using "from the [genre]."

 **Examples:**

- Which sentence from the story **best** supports the inference that Aunt Marge had a happy childhood?
- Which detail from the article **best** supports the answer to Part A?
- Which lines from the poem **best** support the answer to Part A? Select two correct answers.

- Use "sentence" only when all options are grammatically complete sentences that begin with an uppercase letter and have end punctuation.
- Use "evidence", "detail," "phrase," or another term at the discretion of the Content Specialist for all other items with options consisting of quoted text.
- Answer choices that consist of only a few words, phrases, or fragments may be referred to as "phrases," "words," "details," or another term at the discretion of the Content Specialist.
- Items written to poems may refer to "line" or "lines" at the discretion of the Content Specialist.
- Items written to plays may refer to "paragraphs," "dialogue," "stage direction," or "stage directions" at the discretion of the Content Specialist.

**QUOTED TEXT IN ANSWER CHOICES**:

**Capitalization and End Punctuation in Answer Choices**:

- An option that (1) begins with an uppercase letter in the passage and (2) is a grammatically complete sentence, even if it is only part of the entire sentence in the passage, will have end punctuation.
- An option that (1) begins with a lowercase letter in the passage and (2) is a grammatically complete sentence, even if it is only part of the entire sentence in the passage, will NOT have end punctuation.
- Options that are fragments (do not form a grammatically correct sentence) will not have end punctuation unless they have end punctuation in the passage. (Example: "Seriously?") Fragments retain capitalization from the passage. (Example: "They took care of the plants because")
- Options may be a mix of entire and partial but grammatically complete sentences from the passage IF they either all start with an uppercase letter or a lowercase letter, OR there is a 2/2 split between uppercase and lowercase initial letters.
- Example of an acceptable mix for this sample paragraph: The farmer scratched his head and looked at the sky. He sighed softly and walked toward the barn to milk Lottie. He noticed that thecrops were looking dry. As he walked, he thought about the weather forecast.

      A. "The farmer scratched his head."
    
      B. "He sighed softly and walked toward the barn to milk Lottie."

      C. "the crops were looking dry"

      D. "he thought about the weather forecast"

- If options are fragments (do not form grammatically complete sentences), they may all start with anuppercase letter, a lowercase letter, or comprise a 2/2 split. Fragments and grammatically completesentences should not be mixed in answer choices unless Content has given approval.

- Example of an acceptable mix for the sample paragraph above:

            A. "scratched his head"

            B. "sighed softly and walked"

            C. "He noticed that"

            D. "As he walked"

    **Quotation Marks in Answer Choices**

      Long quotations (full sentences, multiple sentences, or partial sentences that are more than a few words long and contain multiple parts of speech—noun/verb; verb/direct object; etc.): Enclose long quotations in quotation marks and use single quotation marks to represent quotation marks from the original text. If a single quotation mark appears next to a double quotation mark, add a space between them. EXCEPTION: For text-support from plays, add the dialogue tag in bold and do NOT use quotation marks.

    **Examples**

  - From a work of fiction: "I changed my mind after I read the final chapter." ( paragraph 9)
  - From a poem: "I think that I shall never see / A poem lovely as a tree." ( lines 1–2)
  - From an article: " ' You never get used to how big they are,' said paleontologist Anna Weng." (paragraph 12)
  - From a play:**JEEVES:** [*Coughs.*] I was as much astonished as yourself, sir. (paragraph 43)

**Ellipses in Answer Choices**:

  In text-support, or text-evidence, items, text that is pulled from the passage should be quoted exactly,although in certain situations, ellipses may be used to represent omitted text.

  - Long quotations (full sentences, multiple sentences, or partial sentences that are more than a few words long and contain multiple parts of speech—noun/verb; verb/direct object; etc.): If text is omitted from the center of a quotation, the omission must be represented by ellipses. Consult*The Chicago Manual of Style*'s guidelines on ellipses. If text is omitted from the beginning or end of a quoted sentence, do NOT include ellipses.
  - For items written to plays, do not use ellipses if dialogue is omitted between the dialogue tag and thebeginning of the quotation.

**Exampe**:

  A play reads:

**BERTIE:** [*Opens message with a flourish.*] I will read it to you. Handed in at Upper Bleaching. Messageruns as follows: "When you come tomorrow, bring my football boots. Also, if humanly possible, Irishwater spaniel. Urgent. Regards. Tuppy." What do you make of that, Jeeves?

  Answer choices could look like this:

    A. **BERTIE:** I will read it to you.
    
    B. **BERTIE:** Message runs as follows: "When you come tomorrow, bring . . . Irish water spaniel."

    C. **BERTIE:** What do you make of that?

  - Short quotations (single words or short phrases such as "black cat," "January sale," "the constellation," etc.) do not use ellipses.

## thesaurus items

**ELA:** In items that test the meaning of a word by presenting a thesaurus entry, the entry is placed in a text box.

  The tested word is boldface and lowercase unless it is a proper noun.

  The part of speech is abbreviated without a period. It is set in lightface (regular) italics, and it precedes the number of the synonym(s) it applies to. Multiple parts of speech may be presented (e.g. "*n*, *adj*").

  Synonyms are numbered with a boldface number followed by a period. Synonyms begin with a lowercase letter unless the first word is a proper noun. They do not include end punctuation. Synonym text is lightface (regular).

  There are no hard returns in the text box. However, TEIs where entries are hotspotted should be formatted with hard returns between synonyms.

## times of day

  Times of day should appear with the hour followed by a colon and the number of minutes, even if they are in whole hours (e.g., "6:00," "10:35").

## trademarked names

  Avoid using trademarked names (e.g., "Kleenex," "Windows," "Popsicle," "Styrofoam," "Ping-Pong"). Replace with generic terms.

  When a trademarked name must be used in a passage (e.g., when the content is about a specific brand), an unregistered trademark symbol (™) or a registered trademark symbol (®) should not be used. According to the *Chicago Manual of Style*, "there is no legal requirement to use these symbols, and they should be omitted wherever possible."

## units of measure

  When units of measure are specified in parentheses in a table or on a graph, do not include the word "in" [e.g., "Length (feet)," not "Length (in feet)"].

  A unit of measure is singular when the measurement includes values from –1 to 1 (except for zero). The unit is plural when the measurement includes zero or values less than –1 or greater than 1 (e.g., "–1 degree Fahrenheit," "0 feet," "0.5 inch," "1.1 miles," "100 kilometers").

  When practical, use singular verbs to refer to quantities (e.g., "How many molecules does 16 grams of oxygen contain?").

  When an item asks for an answer that is a measurement, include the unit of measure in the answer choices. In these cases, the unit should not be repeated in the stem unless there is no better way to express the stem (e.g., "How long is the board? 2 feet," "What was the temperature? 80ºF," but "What percentage of the blocks were black? 10%").

  There are some exceptions:

  - In conversion items, indicating the unit of measure in both the stem and the answer choices may be preferable (e.g., "The board is 2 feet long. How long is the board in inches? 24 inches").
  - In TEIs that include an answer field (for example, items that use the text-entry interaction), the unit of measure should be omitted after the answer field and stated in the stem.
  - In items that ask for answers in the form of an expression, equation, or inequality, the unit of measure should be omitted from the answer choices and stated in the stem (e.g., "Which expression represents the area of the room in square feet? 10*w*<sup>3</sup> + 5*w*<sup>2</sup> – 7*w* + 1").

  If the unit of measure is specified in the stem, there is no need to set off a prepositional phrase indicating the unit with commas. If the stem is so complicated that the prepositional phrase would require commas, it is better to recast the stem so that it reads more naturally (e.g., change "What is the volume, in cubic inches, of a basketball with a diameter of 10 inches?" to "A basketball has a diameter of 10 inches. What is its volume in cubic inches?"; change "What is the length, in feet, that the toy car rolled down the ramp?" to "How many feet did the toy car roll down the ramp?").

  ELA, Math, and Social Studies: Measurements may be presented in SI or metric units or in customary units (also referred to as English units).

  Science: Measurements should be presented in SI or metric units. However, for elementary grades, customary units (Fahrenheit) should be used for temperatures in weather-related contexts.

## URLs, websites

  Do not underline or italicize website URLs.

  Generally, all URLs should include "www" for consistency. Do not include "http:" or "https:". However, URLs in permission lines and image credits should be set exactly as stipulated by the rightsholder.

  Avoid using real URLs unless permission has been acquired from the rightsholder. All fictitious URLs should contain a caret (^) within the URL to ensure that they do not represent a real website.

  If possible, do not begin a sentence with a URL.

## word alternatives

  Do not use parentheses or slashes to present word alternatives [e.g., "a(n)," "bag(s)," "his/her," "and/or"]. The word "or" may be used to present word alternatives, but if possible, recast the sentence instead (e.g., change "Each student turned in his or her paper" to "The students turned in their papers"). To avoid word alternatives at the end of an open-ended stem, move the article into the answer choices (e.g., "an anteater, a bald eagle, an elephant, a dung beetle").

## Rule from*Words into Type*, p. 357

 **Singular with a plural possessive.** To avoid ambiguity a singular noun is often used with a plural possessive when only one of the things possessed could belong to each individual.

  - Manufacturing helps many people in the smaller cities to earn their living.
  - Forbes knew most of them by their first name.
  - Some of them could not pay their rent.
  - They eyed each other furtively and cursed beneath their breath.
  - Four pilots crashed to their death.

  Similarly:

  - Think of the last name of five pupils in the room.
  - The steam line ruptured, causing the death of seven longshoremen.
  - They doubled their efforts to discover the identity of two men who struck a man with their automobile and then fled.

  Care must be taken not to apply the rule to the wrong noun.

 *Wrong*: It is pretty clear that the smile on the*face* of the delegates, whenever they look at each other, is not a sincere one.
 *Right*: . . . on the faces of the delegates . . . [*Smile* is the noun the rule applies to.]
