## EXAMPLE 1: Aggressive Prose Optimization (P25_HS_A037_03)

### THE ITEM (Original)

**P25_HS_A037_03_2**:

**Stem:** How does the author develop the central idea of the excerpt from "How Indigenous Groups Are Using 3-D Technology to Preserve Ancient Practices"?

**Answer Choices:**

- A. By highlighting the role of tribal liaisons to show their importance in preserving relationships between museums and Indigenous communities
- B. By describing joint efforts of museums and Indigenous groups to highlight how technology is used to protect and honor cultural traditions
- C. By explaining the process of 3-D modeling to show its importance to maintaining museum collections of Indigenous artifacts
- D. By describing the advantages of 3-D technology to show that it has tremendous educational value

---

### INITIAL AI REVIEW (What Was Missed):

**QUERIES:**

- Answer choice C (optional prose enhancement): The phrase "reducing dependence on direct guidance and practice with skilled carvers" has a slight structural unevenness. Consider revising. However, current version is grammatically correct. Editor's judgment call.

**EDITS NEEDED:**
None identified.

**What the AI missed:** ALL the major prose optimization opportunities—redundancy, weak verbs, imprecise prepositions, passive voice.

---

### EXPERT HUMAN REVIEW (What Should Have Been Caught):

**QUERIES:**
None.

**EDITS NEEDED:**

--- Stem: Change "of the excerpt" to "in the excerpt" for more natural phrasing.

--- A: Change "By highlighting the role of tribal liaisons to show their importance in preserving relationships" to "By highlighting the role of tribal liaisons in preserving relationships." Removes redundancy—"highlighting" already conveys showing importance.

--- B: Change "describing joint efforts of museums" to "describing joint efforts between museums" for preposition precision. "Between" is more precise than "of" for collaborative relationships.

--- B: Change "how technology is used to protect and honor" to "how technology protects and honors." Converts passive to active voice for stronger, more concise prose.

--- C: Change "By explaining the process of 3-D modeling to show its importance to maintaining museum collections of Indigenous artifacts" to "By explaining how 3-D modeling helps preserve Indigenous artifacts in museum collections." Multiple improvements: "the process of" → "how," "to show its importance to maintaining" → "helps preserve," overall smoother flow.

--- D: Change "to show that it has tremendous educational value" to "to demonstrate its tremendous educational value." Strengthens verb and improves conciseness.

---

### KEY LESSONS FROM THIS EXAMPLE:

#### 1. ✅ **Eliminate Redundancy Aggressively**

**Pattern:** Verb already implies concept stated afterward

- ❌ "highlighting...to show their importance" 
- ✅ "highlighting" (already means showing importance)
- **Rule:** If verb conveys meaning X, delete "to show X" or "to demonstrate X"

#### 2. ✅ **Fix Imprecise Prepositions**

**Pattern:** "of" when more precise preposition exists

- ❌ "joint efforts of museums"
- ✅ "joint efforts between museums"
- **Rule:** "Of" is often vague; use between/among/by/through when more specific

#### 3. ✅ **Convert Passive to Active Voice**

**Pattern:** "is/are used to [verb]" → "[verb]s"

- ❌ "technology is used to protect and honor"
- ✅ "technology protects and honors"
- **Rule:** Active voice is stronger and more concise

#### 4. ✅ **Strengthen Weak Verbs**

**Pattern:** Weak verb + noun phrase → Strong verb

- ❌ "to show that it has tremendous value"
- ✅ "to demonstrate its tremendous value"
- **Rule:** Replace "show that," "indicate that" with stronger single verbs

#### 5. ✅ **Simplify Complex Constructions**

**Pattern:** "the process/method of [gerund]" → "how [subject verb]"

- ❌ "the process of 3-D modeling"
- ✅ "how 3-D modeling"
- **Rule:** Eliminate unnecessary nominalizations

#### 6. ✅ **Don't Just Tweak—Completely Rewrite**
**Complete restructuring is not only allowed, it's expected:**

- ❌ TIMID: Suggesting minor word changes
- ✅ AGGRESSIVE: Completely rewriting wordy answer choice C for maximum clarity and conciseness

## EXAMPLE 2: Pronoun Ambiguity & Active Voice (P25_HS_A037_04)

### THE ITEM (Original)

**P25_HS_A037_04_3**:

**Stem:** How does the author of the excerpt from "How Indigenous Groups Are Using 3-D Technology to Preserve Ancient Practices" best develop the idea that respecting Indigenous groups is important to Smithsonian Museum staff?

**Answer Choices:**

- A. By tracking changes to a single artifact
- B. By listing examples of replication projects
- C. By describing adjustments to their methodology
- D. By outlining the steps in their technical process

---

### INITIAL AI REVIEW (What Was Missed)

**QUERIES:**

- Stem (prose optimization): Consider improvements for conciseness and better flow.

**EDITS NEEDED:**

- Stem: Bold "best" per eStyle.

**What the AI missed:**

1. Ambiguous pronoun "their" in answer choice C
2. Inaccurate museum name shortening
3. Opportunity for active voice construction in stem

---

### EXPERT HUMAN REVIEW (What Should Have Been Caught)

**QUERIES:**

--- Stem: Suggest moving the passage reference to the beginning: "In the excerpt from 'How Indigenous Groups Are Using 3-D Technology to Preserve Ancient Practices,' how does the author best develop the idea that respecting Indigenous groups is important to museum staff?"

We could also use active voice in the second clause: "...the idea that the museum staff place great importance on respecting Indigenous groups?"

NOTE: The full name of the museum is the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (NMNH). To avoid the issue of whether we can shorten to "Smithsonian Museum," suggest using "museum staff." Students will know we're talking about NMNH, the only museum mentioned in the passage.

--- ACs: To avoid ambiguous "their" in C (could refer to museum staff or Indigenous groups mentioned in stem), should we change to "the staff's," and add it to the other ACs as well to prevent an outlier?

- A. By tracking the staff's changes to a single artifact
- B. By listing examples of the staff's replication projects
- C. By describing adjustments to the staff's methodology
- D. By outlining the steps in the staff's technical process

**EDITS NEEDED:**

- Stem: Bold "best" per eStyle.

---

### KEY LESSONS FROM THIS EXAMPLE

#### 1. ✅ **Check for Ambiguous Pronoun References**

**Critical grammar issue:**

- ❌ "their methodology" when stem mentions both "museum staff" AND "Indigenous groups"
- ✅ "the staff's methodology" (makes referent explicit)
- **Rule:** When multiple noun groups appear in stem, pronouns in answer choices MUST be unambiguous

#### 2. ✅ **Verify Proper Names Are Accurate**

**Content accuracy issue:**

- ❌ "Smithsonian Museum" (not the actual name)
- ✅ "museum staff" (avoids the incomplete name problem)
- **Rule:** Check passage for exact names; don't assume shortened versions are acceptable

#### 3. ✅ **Maintain Parallel Structure When Fixing Issues**

**Smart solution:**

- Could fix only answer choice C by changing "their" to "the staff's"
- BUT this creates an outlier (only C has possessive)
- ✅ Add "the staff's" to ALL answer choices for consistency
- **Rule:** When fixing one answer choice, consider whether parallel changes improve the whole set

#### 4. ✅ **Push for Active Voice in Complex Constructions**

**Advanced optimization:**

- ❌ PASSIVE/ABSTRACT: "respecting Indigenous groups is important to museum staff"
- ✅ ACTIVE: "the museum staff place great importance on respecting Indigenous groups"
- **Rule:** Look beyond simple "is used to" patterns—any abstract noun construction can often be made more active

## EXAMPLE 3: Content Accuracy & Natural Phrasing (P25_HS_A037_05)

### THE ITEM (Original)

**P25_HS_A037_05_2**:

**Stem 1 (before box):** Read this sentence from paragraph 8 of the excerpt from "How Indigenous Groups Are Using 3-D Technology to Preserve Ancient Practices."

**Boxed quotation:**
> "We found a way to work together to come to some kind of solution," says Ray Wilson, Sr., a Tlingit elder and leader of the Kiks.ádi. Even in a replicated form, "I believe that the hat wanted to come back home."

**Stem 2 (after box):** The personification in these sentences contributes to the article by emphasizing the —

**Answer Choices:**

- A. logistical challenges of returning cultural items to Indigenous groups
- B. emotional connection that tribal nations have to Indigenous artifacts
- C. crucial role a museum plays in helping Indigenous communities
- D. technical proficiency required to replicate Indigenous objects

---

### INITIAL AI REVIEW (What Was Caught)

**QUERIES:**
None.

**EDITS NEEDED:**

- Stem 1: Change "this sentence" to "these sentences" for accuracy. The boxed text contains two sentences, not one.

**What the AI caught correctly:** ✅ Singular/plural mismatch

**What the AI missed:**

1. Content accuracy issue in Stem 2
2. Article/verb naturalness issue in answer choice C

---

### EXPERT HUMAN REVIEW (What Should Have Been Caught):

**QUERIES:**

--- Stem 2: Change "in these sentences" to "in the second sentence"? The personification is only in the second sentence ("the hat wanted to come back home"), not in both sentences.

Alternate fix: In the boxed quotation, we could omit the first sentence, leaving only "Even in a replicated form, 'I believe that the hat wanted to come back home.'" Then we could use "this sentence" in both Stem 1 and Stem 2.

--- C: Suggest changing "plays" to "can play" OR changing "museum" to "the museum."

- Current: "crucial role a museum plays"
- Option 1: "crucial role a museum can play" (indefinite article + modal verb)
- Option 2: "crucial role the museum plays" (definite article + present tense)

**EDITS NEEDED:**

- Stem 1: Changed "this sentence" to "these sentences" (but see query above).

---

### KEY LESSONS FROM THIS EXAMPLE

#### 1. ✅ **Don't Just Fix Grammar—Verify Content Claims**

**Critical thinking issue:**

- ✅ AI caught: "sentence" should be "sentences" (grammar)
- ❌ AI missed: Is the claim "in these sentences" even accurate?
- **Reality:** Personification is ONLY in the second sentence
- **Rule:** When fixing technical errors, ALSO verify the content claim is true

#### 2. ✅ **Article + Verb Combinations Must Be Natural**

**Subtle naturalness issue:**

- ❌ "crucial role a museum plays" (indefinite article + present tense = awkward)
- ✅ "crucial role a museum can play" (indefinite + modal = natural)
- ✅ "crucial role the museum plays" (definite + present = natural)
- **Rule:** Read answer choices aloud mentally; indefinite article + present tense often feels off

#### 3. ✅ **Consider Multiple Solutions to Problems**

**Strategic thinking:**

- Problem: Personification claim accuracy
- Solution 1: Change "these sentences" to "the second sentence"
- Solution 2: Remove first sentence from box, keep "this sentence"
- **Rule:** Offer alternative fixes when multiple valid approaches exist

## QUICK REFERENCE: Most Common Patterns to Catch

### ⚠️ REDUNDANCY PATTERNS (Delete the redundant part):

- `[Verb implying X]...to show/demonstrate X` → Delete "to show X"
- "highlighting...to show importance" → "highlighting"
- "emphasizing...to stress" → "emphasizing"
- "describing...to illustrate" → "describing"

### ⚠️ WEAK VERB PATTERNS (Strengthen):

- "show that it has" → "demonstrate its" / "reveal its"
- "is used to [verb]" → "[verb]s" (active voice)
- "make it possible to" → "enables" / "allows"
- "serve to [verb]" → "[verb]s"

### ⚠️ PREPOSITION ISSUES (Be more precise):

- "efforts of [groups]" → "efforts between [groups]"
- "the process of [gerund]" → "how [subject verb]"
- "role of [noun]" → "role [noun] plays" / "[noun]'s role"

### ⚠️ PRONOUN AMBIGUITY (Make explicit):

- "their" when stem has multiple noun groups → Use explicit possessive
- Check: Can "their/it/they" refer to more than one antecedent?

### ⚠️ CONTENT ACCURACY (Verify claims):

- Stem says "these sentences" → Verify claim applies to ALL sentences
- Stem says "paragraph X" → Verify details are actually from paragraph X
- Proper names → Check passage for exact names, don't shorten

### ⚠️ ARTICLE + VERB NATURALNESS (Read aloud):

- "a [noun] plays" → Often awkward; try "a [noun] can play" or "the [noun] plays"
- "a [noun] is" vs "the [noun] is" → Choose based on specificity

## YOUR CALIBRATION CHECKLIST

Before starting your first review, verify you understand:

- [ ] **Redundancy elimination is mandatory**, not optional—even when original is "acceptable"
- [ ] **Weak verbs must be strengthened**, especially "show that," "is used to" patterns
- [ ] **Pronouns must be unambiguous**—when stem mentions multiple groups, make referents explicit
- [ ] **Content claims must be verified**—don't just fix grammar without checking if the claim is accurate
- [ ] **Complete rewrites are expected**—don't be timid; restructure entire answer choices if needed
- [ ] **Natural phrasing matters**—read answer choices aloud mentally to catch awkward constructions

**When in doubt:** Ask yourself, "Would RICHIE or an expert human editor suggest this improvement?" If yes, include it in EDITS NEEDED (not QUERIES).
