# Style and Formatting • VASOL History and Social Science

**NOTE:** 2024 is the first year we have had VASOL Social Studies, and we're still figuring out the style. We'll update these notes, and eStyle if we can, as we receive information. As of 2025, we're still updating!

## **Abbreviating Units of Measurement**

For now, follow the eStyle guidelines for Reading.

## **African Americans**

**NOTE: As of January 14, 2025, Content is still using this style, offensive as it is.** VDOE has established that how to refer to African Americans depends on the period in US history (curiously, this seems to be an issue almost entirely in grade 4):

- *Up to the American Revolution*, they should be referred to as "**enslaved (or free) Africans**"; this is not ideal but is at least not inaccurate on its face, since it covers a period entirely before Congress abolished the overseas slave trade in 1808.
- *From the American Revolution through the Civil War*, they are referred to as "**enslaved or free Blacks**"; this is contra eStyle and best practice, but repeated queries have made no headway in changing it.
- Throughout the period of slavery, they may also be referred to as "**enslaved people**."
- *From the conclusion of the Civil War (1865)*, they are referred to as "**African Americans**."

## **Art**

- Titles (required in all standalone art): Bold, headline cap, centered above art <font color=red>**NEW**</font>: No longer necessarily required—no need to query as of 2024 FER.
- Labels within art: **Headline cap** (i.e. "Toy Car") unless label is a complete sentence ("Heat pump collects warm air.")
- Keys: A colon follows "Key", and text is headline capped.
- If needed, a "(not to scale)" label should be added.
- Captions below art: Always **initial cap**; centered if fragment, left-aligned if sentence ("Mountain lion", "This is not a drill.")
- Graphic Gap Match (follows Science style):
  - Bay title: Bold, headline cap, centered
  - Draggers: Lightface, **initial cap**, centered in box; sentences have end punctuation
- Graphic organizers:
  - Title: Bold, headline cap, centered
  - Ovals ("main text"): Bold, headline cap, centered
  - Boxes ("supporting text"): Lightface, **initial cap**, centered
- Hot Spot options: **Initial cap**, centered in box; may have end punctuation

## **Associated Stimuli**

As in other VASOL subjects, when there is more than one stimulus, all must be associated with an item, and the stimulus relevant to the item will be active.

## **Black**

Uppercase for History **ONLY**. See `racial and ethnic terms`, below.

## **Boxed Text and Quotations, Style and Content**

Text that is quoted from a **public domain** foundational document such as the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, or a historical Supreme Court decision, should use standard American spelling as provided in the American Heritage Dictionary (Content approved this on 1/28/25). It is fine to change British spellings or unconventional spellings to modern American ones during initial review, but please indicate in your notes that you have done so. Unconventional capitalization should be left to match whatever source is used in the RL documentation.

Errors in public domain text that is not foundational (e.g., a quotation from NASA or the Department of the Interior on a present-day website) may be corrected, but again, check against the attached documentation and indicate any changes you have made. If unsure, you may always query instead.

Quotations from text that is not in the public domain must match the source exactly. Query any problematic language or errors.

## **Boxed Text, Formatting**

**Editorial is no longer responsible for formatting**, but add a query if you notice boxed text is not set as a table, along the lines of `-- Boxed text: Needs to be set as table per Pubs` so that we can alert Content.

ℹ️ As background, this is being done per Pubs and client preference. Because of the extent to which Social Studies uses boxed lists, all boxed text should be set as tables rather than text boxes. This allows for the width of the box to be adjusted and the box to be centered within an item.

## **Bulleted/Numbered Lists**

At client meeting on 5/2/24, client rejected the idea that we should adhere strictly to Gregg and asked that we add some new SS examples to eStyle. Bullets should instead be initial cap. Here are some examples of what the client wants for SS:

> **<center>Immigration Push Factors</center>**
>
> - Lack of economic opportunities
> - Discrimination on the basis of religion
> - Lack of social services and health care

________________________________________________________

> **<center>The Growth of ?</center>**
>
> - There was a deep harbor where ships could port.
> - The climate was favorable for the cultivation of cash crops.
> - There were no prior claims to the mineral rights.

## **Capitalization (Headline-Style)**

- Per Gregg ¶361, capitalize prepositions of four letters or more: *Number of Farms Dealing **With** Drought*
- Per Gregg ¶363, hyphens are like spaces for capitalization purposes—e.g., "x-rays" in an art label must be fully headline-capped: "X-Rays".

## **darker-shaded vs. darkly-shaded**

It should always be "darker-shaded" as an adjective. The point is to compare the shadings, and one is darker than the others. "The darker-shaded region on this map is . . ." If the map has only one shaded area, refer to "The shaded region/area/other noun . . ."

## **Direction Lines**

**Multiselect items:** As of 8/27/24, these should have a DL only if the number of correct responses is **not** given in the stem. The DL should be in the form

- **Directions: Select [x] correct answers.**

**Hotspot items, 9/5/24:** Contra eStyle, hotspot items will not have a separate DL and stem. The combined DL and stem will read along the lines of "Select the location of Nubia on the map." See WH item VIWT190001 for an example.

**Items with Draggers:** As of 8/27/24: Chris Rutt confirmed per VDOE that TEIs with draggers (Match, Gap Match Table...) must refer to the number of draggers moved. There are 2 approved styles.

1. One can be found in VIWG190002:

   **Directions: Drag the answers to the correct boxes.**

   **Determine whether each sentence describes a Mercator or Robinson map projection. Each box will contain two sentences.**

2. The other can be found in VIWG190003.

   **Directions: Drag the answers to the correct boxes.**

   **Match three continents to their descriptions.**

**Inline Choice Items:** As of 3/12/25, per Content, the DL for inline choice (all grades) should be

- **Directions: Select the correct answer(s).**

  - Inline choice items will always have the same stem: "Complete the sentence(s)."

  - As of 9/26/25, per Content, this DL and stem should always be kept together, even if the item has an image or text box. Note that this is contra eStyle's rule to always put the DL at the top ("Item direction lines are entered as the first line of text within an item that requires them"). See VICE200129.

**Match Table Grid Items:** As of 8/27/24, per Content and VDOE, the DL for MTG should be:

- **Directions: Select the correct answer in each row.**

- **[Stem wording will vary per item.]**

  Regardless of DL wording for an item, **do not rewrite the stem**. There are various constraints on stem language that are mostly not in eStyle, so leave rewrites to the lead.

**"Intro" Direction Lines, per client style decisions doc dated summer 2024:**

- These are the direction lines you will see above certain visuals in an item (usually photos, maps, graphs, and the like). The intent here is to tell students what they are looking at. Stimuli with a title (e.g., a map titled "Virginia") will NOT have a direction line. This way, we will not have a direction line directing students to "Look at a map of Virginia" and then show them a map titled "Virginia."

- **UPDATE:** In Grade 4, client requested removing intro lines above art when the art is referred to in the stem. This might apply only to Grade 4, where intro lines are required to be simple and thus are in danger of simply echoing the stem.

- Direction lines are meant to be simple and not repeat information in the actual stimulus.

- For informational stimuli that students read, use "Read the information about x". Examples:

  - Read the information about a Chinese dynasty.

  - Read the information about the federal government.

  - Read the information about an invention.

- Grade 4 direction lines can be simpler:

  - Read the information.

  - Read the list.

- For **non-titled** graphic stimuli (e.g., graphs, political cartoons, photographs), use "Examine the x":

  - Examine the photograph of a young girl.

  - Examine the bar graph of a population trend.

- Grade 4:

  - Look at the graph.

  - Look at the photograph.

  **NOTE:** For stimuli which require additional context/background, this information would appear first in the direction line followed by the actual direction line (e.g., Daniel Boone was a man. He was a big man. He fought for America to keep America free. Examine the photograph of him.)

## **Emphasis**

Per eStyle, "The words 'NOT' and 'EXCEPT' are the only words that receive emphasis treatment," and even these words will not always be emphasized.

## **Glossed Words**

**As of 9/18/25, only complete sentences end with a period. Fragments have no period.**

Glosses should say "Glossary Definition." A definition should begin with a capital letter *except* in the case of a one-word definition ("one-word" includes compound words and phrasal verbs, such as "fall behind" and "black powder"). A one-word definition is capped to fit the word being defined and has no end period. For example, "bequeath" in mid-sentence would be glossed as "hand down" with no end period. The only time you should see pop-up glosses in VASOL History is in a primary source, typically to explain an archaic term or high-level vocab.

## **Historical Names**

Note that eStyle now has a `names list` in addition to the usual word list.

## **Hyphens**

- When in doubt, do not hyphenate. For instance, in Gregg-land, a cat that is both orange and gray is an "orange and gray cat" (¶827b).
- Do not hyphenate a number and unit of measurement used as a compound adjective, regardless of whether the unit is abbreviated (e.g., a 5 M solution, 2 liter bottle).

## **Inline Choice Items**

- <font color="red">**NEW:**</font> There is a DL and a stem. See `direction lines`, above.
- Drop-downs should be "no smaller than medium."
- Apply a nobreak span tag around any DD box and following punctuation.
- Content adds vertical space between sentences when drop-down options would cover text. Do not delete instances of `&#160;` if they appear to be placed for that reason.

## **Maps**

- Land is shaded or with patterns; water is white.
- Maps should use proper USGS symbols.
- Use italics for labels of water features (rivers, lakes, oceans); roman for labels for landmasses (cities, countries, continents).
- Inset maps will be placed below the main map aligned bottom left (subject to change)

## **Match Table Grids**

Sentences in column 1 are left-aligned. Headers are bold, centered, and headline-capped. This accords with eStyle's rules for tables in general.

## **Multiple-Select Items**

There should be a DL only if the number of correct answers is not specified in the stem. The direction line wording is "**Directions: Select x correct answers.**" There should be five or six options. Multiselect items do NOT use option labels (no ABCDE, in other words).

## **Nobreak Span Tags**

- Note that VASOL has nb spans around all hyphenated words and around all numerals and nouns (not just units of measure: [3 apples], [4 gold] medals)
- Always put a nobreak span tag around a numeral and a following noun.

## **Numbers**

- Generally, SS should follow Gregg's "word" style (¶404).
- However, per eStyle, use numerals for constitutional amendments: "the 14th Amendment"
- Spell out fractions in stems. And per Gregg, fractions are hyphenated in all forms unless the second element is already hyphenated, e.g.:

  - one-quarter,  
  - one and three-quarters,
  - but *one twenty-fifth*

- For percentages, use a numeral and spell out percent; the "%" sign may be used if percentages appear in tables or other technical material, per Gregg ¶447.

## **Play Button**

Items with videos have a direction line with an arrow symbol. This can be set in the source code:

```xml
<p><strong>Directions: Select the <img src="/v1/assets/4d2a7895-5ee2-43c4-86fa-fa144933e46c" alt="play button" width="41" height="41" /> to watch the video.</strong></p>
```

## **Racial and Ethnic Terms**

As of September 2024, the VDOE History team wants capitalization of racial and ethnic terms to match what is in the standards of learning and in their instructional guides. We are not expected to check those sources—Content will relay VDOE style requests to us as they are made. What we know for now is that contra eStyle, "African American" is not the default term, "Black" is uppercase, "white" is lowercase, and other terms are awaiting final decisions. These decisions apply to current development only as we move forward. There will be no bank sweep. There will be no edits to previous development unless specifically requested by Content or the client.

**Update**: 1/14/25, from Lisa Fleck: The RLs were told this:

Another note from Dave R. regarding word usage as determined by Virginia Dept of Education for VASOL SS items:

```plaintext
Hi Janet, wanted to clarify something I sent you on Friday regarding word usage:

- until the American Revolution: "enslaved Africans"
- American Revolution until Civil War: "free Blacks" and "enslaved Blacks" when distinguishing between those groups; "enslaved people" when referring only to people who were enslaved
- After the Civil War: "African Americans"
```

## **Source Lines**

Source lines go underneath the table, graph, etc., and are right-aligned per eStyle (but should not extend beyond the right-most edge of the table, graph, etc.). Sometimes you will encounter tables with a mis-aligned source line (usually left-aligned). To right-align it the correct way, set the "class" element as "right cite." Under a table, the source code should look like this:

```HTML
<td class="right cite">Source: [Add Source Here].</td>
```

## **Stem Layout**

The stem question should always be between a display (tables/art/equations/text box) and the options below. It's OK to have no text above the display. OK to move stem question from above to below in initial review.

Note that VDOE does *not* like long stems to be separated into paragraphs. Unless a display appears in the stem, the text should all be together in one lump.

Either charge statements or questions may be used in TEI items, though the current preference is generally for charge statements.

## **Tables**

- All tables and charts are centered and generally should have a title styled as "Title."
- A table is called a "table."
- Align all text in table per Layout > table layout, table text alignment.
- Cell padding of 8.
- Add an extra line below (or above) to separate tables from stems.
- Spell out units only if they are not used in the stem.
- Capitalization: *Headers* are centered and headline-capped. In *cells*, follow Art > graphic gap match, graphic gap match dragger capitalization (generally, sentence-capped).

## **Which**

Note that VASOL does not require a noun after "Which." But do try to add a noun at least during initial review. If no noun makes sense, use "Which of these."

## **Style Information Not in eStyle**

- "Which statement" (not "Which of these statements")
- "these types (not kinds) of things."
- "According to this" (not "the") excerpt,...
- No options that are exact opposites. ("Birds always fly south in the winter." "Birds always fly north in the winter." OR "Birds never fly south in the winter.")
