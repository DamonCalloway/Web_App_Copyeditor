# eStyle: VASOL

## A.M., P.M

These should be set in "tiny caps" with periods. Set them in full-size caps and then apply the ABBI "tiny caps" style. When they appear within bold text, set them with bold treatment by applying the ABBI "tiny caps bold" style.

In order to avoid confusion, references to "12:00 A.M." and "12:00 P.M." should be expressed as "midnight" and "noon." See Gregg ¶440h for more.

## abbreviations, acronyms and initialisms

Typically, words and phrases are spelled out on first reference. If the acronym or initialism is more commonly used than the spelled-out phrase or the spelled-out phrase would be confusing for the population being assessed, the initials may be included in parentheses immediately after the first reference. Some examples are shown below:

- Global Positioning System (GPS)
- Computer-generated image (CGI)
- Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
- North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)

In some cases it may be preferable to footnote acronyms. In ER passages, for example, footnoting longer acronyms may be necessary for previously published (permissioned) pieces.

Acronyms or initialisms may be used in titles, section headers, captions, art labels, graphics, and answer choices as long as the word or phrase is spelled out on the first reference in the main body of text.

Certain common acronyms or initialisms may be used without spelling out on the first reference. Many of these will be listed as main entries rather than as abbreviations in the American Heritage Dictionary (e.g., NASA, DNA, JPEG, laser, scuba).

When an indefinite article precedes an acronym or initialism, the choice of a or an is determined by the way the acronym or initialism is pronounced (e.g., "a UFO," "a NATO member," "an FBI agent").

## abbreviations, units of measurement

**Reading, Grades 3–8 and EOC**:

Spell out units of measurement unless the passage and items are intended to test the ability to understand technical language.

**Math**:

**Grade 3:** Units of measurement are spelled out in all text. This includes the stem, art, and answer options.

**Grades 4-5:**

If more than one unit of measurement is used in an item, the units should be spelled out in all instances.

For metric measurement, the units of measurement should be spelled out in the stem. The abbreviation for each unit should be provided in parentheses [e.g., meters (m)] if the unit is going to be used in art or options. The abbreviation should be used in options.

In a stem using the U.S. customary units of measurement listed below, the abbreviation can be provided in parentheses [e.g., feet (ft)] after the unit if the unit is going to be used in art or options.

- inch/inches
- foot/feet
- yard/yards
- mile/miles
- square inch/square inches
- square foot/square feet

All other U.S. customary units should be spelled out in stem, art, and options.

**Grades 6–7:** Abbreviate units of measurement in options if the unit is spelled out in the stem. Use exponents when abbreviating metric units (e.g., cm2). For customary units, "sq" and "cu" may be used with the abbreviated unit (e.g., sq in.). Abbreviated units of measurement may be used in art if the unit is spelled out in the stem. Note: If an item about area spells out "inches" in the stem and the answer options are "sq in.", it is okay for the units in the answer options to be abbreviated.

**Grades 8+:** Spell out the first use of the unit of measurement and abbreviate subsequent uses, including in answer options. Always abbreviate units of measurement in art.

**Math and Science, Grades 5 and up: Temperature:**

In stems, the first use of a unit of measurement should be spelled out, with the abbreviation following in parentheses [e.g., degrees Celsius (°C)].

**Science, Grades 5 and 8:**

In stems, the first use of a unit of measurement should be spelled out with the abbreviation following in parentheses; e.g., centimeters (cm), degrees Celsius (°C).

In options, abbreviate units of measurement if the unit has been spelled out in the stem.

Always abbreviate units of measurement in art.

Units of measurement in table headers should be spelled out if they are not used in the stem; otherwise, abbreviations should be used; e.g., "Distance (m)"  "Time (s)"

When writing chemical abbreviations, write the abbreviation followed by the name in parentheses on the first use: BMR (basal metabolic rate). Exceptions are made for very common terms that do not need explanation, such as DNA, RNA, and ATP, and when providing the abbreviation would clue the correct answer.

**Hyphenation with abbreviated compound adjectives**:

**Reading and Math:** Do not hyphenate a number and an abbreviated unit of measurement when used as a compound adjective (e.g., a 5 L solution). However, hyphenate compound adjectives that consist of a number and a spelled out unit of measurement (e.g., a 5-liter solution).

**Science:** Do not hyphenate a number and an abbreviated unit of measurement when used as a compound adjective in any case, whether abbreviated or spelled out (e.g., a 5 L solution, a 5 liter solution).

For VDOE-approved abbreviations for standard units of measurement, see the [ancillary test materials](Middle_School_Geometric_Formulas.png).

**Technical abbreviations:**

- b for bit
- B for byte
- KB for kilobyte
- MB for megabyte
- GB for gigabyte
- TB for terabyte
- PB for petabyte
- kcal for kilocalories

## according to vs. based on

An accurate distinction should be made between "according to" and "based on." "According to" is used when information is taken directly from a source. "Based on" is used when an inference must be made from a source. "Based on" is more commonly used in assessment because items typically require a student to make a cognitive leap. (Note that "According to" may be difficult vocabulary for lower grades.)

## actors

**Science only:** Use third-person point-of-view impersonal references rather than names to refer to actors in a scenario (e.g., "the student" rather than "Joe").

## addresses

In fictional contexts, streets, cities, and ZIP codes should be fictitious but realistic (e.g., "1201 Oak Street, Appleton, TN 34028," not "1111 Main Street, Anytown, TN 00000").

## alt text

Only Text-to-Speech (TTS) items use the alt text field. For all other items, the alt text fields in ABBI should not be used. If an item writer has mistakenly placed text in the alt text field, it should be deleted.

Alt text appears when the user hovers the mouse cursor over an element that has alt text. In the first screenshot below, the graph has alt text, which has been revealed in a popup by hovering over the graph.

To delete alt text, click to edit the element in ABBI and look for the alt text field. In the second screenshot below, the location of the alt text for the art element is shown.

Note: The alt text popups should not be confused with the popups for the distractor rationales (see third screenshot below), which have a similar appearance.

### Images

## amendments

History: Do not spell out the ordinal when referencing amendments (e.g., 1st Amendment, not First Amendment). Capitalize "amendment" when referencing a specific amendment.

## answer options, because clauses

Answer choices that give a short answer (e.g., one word, a number, or an expression or equation) or an independent clause followed by a rationale in the form of a "because" clause may include a comma before the "because" clause depending on whether the clause is restrictive or nonrestrictive.

Generally, for simple stems that ask "what" or the equivalent and for which the "because" clause is only a rationale and not an answer to the question, the clause is considered nonrestrictive and is preceded by a comma. For example:  

- What is the length of the board? 4 feet, because 2 + 2 = 4
- What is the tone of the passage? Nostalgia, because the narrator is remembering his childhood
- Which organisms are secondary consumers in this ecosystem? Hawks, because they prey on rabbits
- Should the writer delete this sentence? Yes, because it does not support the claim of the paragraph

For stems that ask or imply a twofold question of "what" and "why" or the equivalent, the "because" clause is part of the answer to the question and not merely a rationale for the answer. Therefore, in these cases, it is restrictive and not preceded by a comma. The "because" clause also is considered restrictive if the preceding answer or independent clause is the same in more than one answer choice. In these cases, the "because" clause is restricting the correct answer to just one answer choice, and it is not preceded by a comma. For example:  

> Marissa says that a rectangle cannot have 4 congruent sides. Joan says that a rectangle can have 4 congruent sides.
>
> Who is correct, and why?
>
> A. Joan is correct because a square is a rectangle.
>
> B. Marissa is correct because a rectangle has 4 sides of different lengths.
>
> C. Joan is correct because a rectangle has 4 right angles.
>
> D. Marissa is correct because a rectangle has only 2 congruent sides.

For more information, see Gregg ¶132 ("because").

## answer options, capitalization

For open-ended stems, i.e., stems that end with a space and an em dash, the first word in each answer option is lowercase, except for proper nouns, titles, or uppercase words in art or stimuli.

For closed stems (usually ending with a question mark), the default is to capitalize the first word in each answer option. The first word is lowercase when the word is from art or stimulus text in which the word is lowercase.

**ELA:** Lowercase the first word in answer options when

- the item is testing a prefix or a suffix
- the item is testing guide words in a dictionary
- the word or sentence is lowercase and underlined in a passage or draft
- the options quote a passage excerpt and the first word is lowercase in the passage
- the item is testing a lowercase word from the passage
- the answer options are definitions of a lowercase word in the passage

## answer options, dictionary items

**ELA:** Answer options that consist of numbered references to definitions should include the numeral only. The word "Definition" should not precede the numeral.

**Associated Link:**

[dictionary definition boxes (Language)](#dictionary-definition-boxes)

## answer options, end punctuation

Include end punctuation for options if the options are sentences, including imperatives. If the options complete a sentence from an open-ended stem, i.e., a stem that ends with a space and an em dash, do not include end punctuation for options. If options are a mix of complete and incomplete sentences, do not include end punctuation for any options.

**Math only:** Answer options that begin with a numeral should not have ending punctuation.

**Math and Science only:** Do not use end punctuation in answer options that compare numbers, whether a symbol is used or the comparison is spelled out.

Examples:

- 7 is less than 10
- 7 < 10

## answer options, language

*Note: The following guidelines are applied at the client's discretion. The client may elect to vary from these guidelines at any time.*

All answer options may be written in parallel language, or two answer options may be written parallel to each other and the other two parallel to each other. This requirement includes the use of proper nouns and the use of the articles a/an/the.

**History:** If a stem references a president, leader, Virginian, etc., all options must be the same type (e.g., all presidents, all leaders, all Virginians, etc.).

**Reading/ELA:** Reduce repeated words in options by rephrasing options or by moving repeated words to the stem. Use "vs." rather than "versus" in answer options.

**Writing:** Avoid using tested sentences as answer options in other items. When answer options are sentence numbers, the numbers should be close together.

## answer options, order

Numeric answer options are listed in ascending or descending order except when

- the order needs to be changed to avoid sequential answers
- the order clues the answer to any item in the form (to be determined by the content specialist)
- the relative value or order of the number is being assessed
- the options are taken from a table or chart in the stem, in which case the options must be listed in the same order as they appear in the table or chart

**Reading/ELA:** Options quoted from a passage must be in the same order as they appear in the passage. For options consisting of paired words, however, first alphabetize within the pair and then place options in passage order, i.e., according to the appearance in the passage of the first word in the pair.

**Writing:** When listing sentence numbers in options, the sentences should be close rather than spread throughout the passage. (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 7 rather than 6, 8, 9, 17)

**Math:** Ordered pairs that are answer options are listed in ascending or descending order according to the first coordinate.

**Science and Social Studies:** Non-numeric options may be in random order unless they are taken from a graphic (e.g., a table or a list), in which case they should match the order in the graphic.

## answer options, paragraph numbers

**Reading/ELA**: Answer options that consist of paragraph numbers should include the numeral only. The word "Paragraph" should not precede the numeral.

## answer options, poetry

**Reading/ELA:** End punctuation is included when all answer options consist of full lines of poetry. End punctuation is not included when the answer options consist of only part of a line of a poem. When answer options consist of a mix of full and partial lines, do not include ending punctuation.

## answer options, quotations

Text culled from a passage should appear as it appears in the passage. Only text that is in quotation marks in the passage should appear in quotation marks in an item.

Quotation marks should also be used if the culled text is part of a lengthier section of dialogue.

## answer options, units of measurement

Note: For treatment of abbreviations with units of measurement, see the Language "abbreviations, units of measurement" entry linked below.

**Math, Grades 3–8:** Repeat the unit of measurement in answer options.

**Grade 3 example:**

> How many inches long is the board?
>
> **A.**   2 inches
>
> **B.**   4 inches
>
> **C.**   6 inches
>
> **D.**   8 inches

**Grades 4–8 example:**

> How many inches long is the board?
>
> **A.**   2 in.
>
> **B.**   4 in.
>
> **C.**   6 in.
>
> **D.**   8 in.

**Math, EOC:** The unit of measurement may be eliminated from answer options if the unit is included in the stem.

**EOC example:**

> How many inches long is the board?
>
> **A.**   2
>
> **B.**   4
>
> **C.**   6
>
> **D.**   8

An exception can be made when conversions are assessed and the client determines that the unit should be repeated in the answer options for clarity.

## art references

**Reading:** When referencing a piece of art from the passage in an item, use descriptive language in order to distinguish between multiple pieces of art and/or to help the student locate the referenced piece of art. Do not number the pieces of art and refer to them by number (e.g., "Photograph 1"). Describe the location of the art in every case, regardless of the number of pieces of art in the passage. Use specific and appropriate language when referencing the piece of art (e.g., "photograph," "picture," "map").

Examples of appropriate ways to refer to art:

- "The photograph/map/picture between paragraphs **and** . . ."
- "The photograph/map/picture that follows paragraph x . . ."
- "The photograph/map/picture at the beginning/end of the article/story/etc. . . ."

Wording may vary at the discretion of AS or the client.

[directional words (Language)](#directional-words)

## B.C. (B.C.E.), A.D. (C.E.)

These should be set in "tiny caps" with periods. Set them in full-size caps and then apply the ABBI "tiny caps" style. When they appear within bold text, set them with bold treatment by applying the ABBI "tiny caps bold" style.

B.C. and A.D. are preferred; however, B.C.E. and C.E. are acceptable. Do not mix styles (A.D. and C.E., for example).

B.C. follows the year; A.D. precedes it. See Gregg ¶1101 for more.

Use A.D. only if needed for clarification or to avoid confusion. (e.g., A.D. 500, but not A.D. 1776)

**Writing:** Use full-size caps and include periods.

**Associated Link:**

[A.M., P.M. (Language)](#am-pm)

## Bohr models

**Science:** Bohr models may only be used when compared with new models.

## boxed text

**History:** Quotation marks are not used around text in boxes. Do not begin boxed text with a drop cap.

**Writing:** Do not include the sentence number in the box.

**Reading:** Text from the passage that is placed above the stem is boxed. A word being tested (i.e., vocabulary word, contraction, synonym, antonym, homonym) is underlined when it appears in boxed text. However, tested words or phrases in quotation marks in the stem are not placed in quotation marks in the boxed text. The letters of a prefix or a suffix being assessed are underlined in boxed text. Use quotation marks only if they are used in the passage.

If the first sentence of a paragraph from the associated passage is quoted in a text box, set it with an indent by using the character code for an em space. (See below.) This indent should not be applied if the passage does not have paragraph numbers (e.g., many functional passages).

Character code for an em space : `&#8195;`

## bulleted/numbered lists

**All subjects:** Use periods after independent clauses, dependent clauses, or long phrases that are displayed on separate lines in a list. Also use periods after short phrases that are essential to the grammatical completeness of the statement introducing the list.

No periods are needed after short phrases in a list if the introductory statement is grammatically complete or if the listed items are like those on an inventory sheet or a shopping list. For more examples, see Gregg 107.

*Examples*:

Do not forget that:

- You must bring your own flashlight.
- You will need a rain jacket in case the weather is bad.
- You will need two bottles of water.

---

For the camping trip, do not forget to pack the following items:

1. Flashlight
2. Rain jacket
3. Two bottles of water

---

Susan has some marbles in a jar. She has —

- 138 green marbles.
- 56 blue marbles.

---

The style outlined in Gregg is recommended, but exceptions can be made at the discretion of the client.

## can be placed

**Math:** When referring to a number that can be placed in an empty box in order to make a number sentence true, use the words "can be placed" rather than "goes" or "belongs."

## captions

All captions are boldfaced. They are initial-capped (not headline-capped), regardless of whether they are complete sentences or fragments. Complete sentences have ending punctuation and are left-aligned. Fragments do not have ending punctuation and are centered under the art.

*Whenever there is a caption in passage art, a 25-pixel padding will be added at the bottom of the art. This increases the space between the caption and the next paragraph.

## centuries

Spell out the ordinal when referencing the first through tenth centuries. Use numeric ordinals for the 11th century and beyond. (e.g., eighth century, 15th century)

## chart/diagram

For Grade 3 Reading only: Do not use the word "diagram" to refer to any graphic. All references should be to "chart."

## chemical elements, formulas, equations

**Elements and formulas**

Write the name followed by the abbreviation in parentheses:

- calcium (Ca)

- carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)

**Chemical equations**

Centered, generally not boxed. When the equation is too wide to fit on one line, reactants are left-aligned on the first line, and products are right-justified on the second line.

For chemical names such as transitional metals that include a roman numeral, there should be no space before the parentheses:

- iron(III) oxide

- lead(II) nitrate

## commas

Include a serial, or Oxford, comma before the conjunction in a series. (e.g., steak, eggs, and toast)

Include a comma in a numeral with four or more digits, except in numbers that do not normally take commas, such as temperatures, angle degrees, street addresses, years, and ZIP codes.

Include a comma between the name of a city and the name of a state, and include a comma after the name of the state. (e.g., We moved from Cleveland, Ohio, to San Antonio, Texas.)

Include a comma before and after "Jr." and "Sr." (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr., was a great leader.) Exception: "Martin Luther King, Jr. Day" (no following comma).

## commas, introductory clauses and phrases

Whether a comma follows an introductory clause or phrase is determined by several factors, including, but not limited to, sentence complexity, length of the phrase, and sentence clarity.

In general, include a comma after introductory elements

- Well,
- In paragraph 3,
- Unfortunately,

Do not include a comma after introductory adverbs or short phrases that answer such questions as when or where.

- One morning
- Today
- In 2006
- In England

However, when an introductory adverb or phrase functions transitionally, commas are used. See Gregg ¶124b.

Example 1:

Yesterday the market closed before we could get there. Today we are planning to go early. ["Today" in this case is used merely to answer the question "when." It means literally "this day."]

Example 2:

Before the invention of airplanes, it was impossible to travel quickly across the country. Today, people can fly across the country in less than eight hours. ["Today" does not literally mean "this day;" it is used to indicate a contrast to the way things used to be.]

On occasion, courtesy commas may be used for the sake of readability, especially in cases when an introductory phrase is longer than a few words. ["One morning long ago, a king awoke with an idea."] Ultimately, the decision of whether a comma should or should not be used is the client's.

**History:** Commas are used after introductory phrases, including those giving the time context (e.g., In 1975, the Senate ...; During the Civil War, the ...).

## compass roses

A compass rose should not be included when lines of latitude and longitude are shown on the map. A compass rose should only be included on the map if it is needed to get the correct directional answer. The rose can be placed inside or outside the art.

## computer commands, key names

Capitalize the names of commands and keys, but lowercase the terms "key" and "button" if they follow the names.

Examples:

- Press Enter to create a new line.
- Press the Enter key to create a new line.
- the Option button
- Page Setup
- Print Preview
- Spacebar
- Spell Check
- Toolbar
- Word Count

## consumer levels

**Science:** Use "first-order consumer," "second-order consumer," and "third-order consumer" instead of primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers.

contractions

**Reading:**

- Passages: Contractions may be used at the client's discretion in commissioned passages to accommodate the author's voice or to achieve a conversational tone. It is best to avoid contractions formed with "-'d," because "-'d" may represent either "had" or "would," and contractions formed with "-'s," because "-'s" may represent either "is" or "has."

- Items: Do not use contractions in items unless they appear in text pulled from the passage.

**Writing:** The rules for Reading apply; however, do not use a contraction if the same contraction is being assessed elsewhere in the passage.

**History:** Contractions are used in stimuli at the discretion of the item writer and the content expert.

## coordinate grids

Grid titles: Titles are required on all coordinate grids that are one quadrant unless there is a clueing issue.

## coordinates, ordered pairs

**Math:** There is no space between a point label and its coordinates [e.g., "*W*(6, 1)"].

## court cases

The names of court cases are italicized, including the "v." Do not italicize the date of court cases.

- *Brown v. Board of Education*
- *Dred Scott v. Sandford*
- *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954)

## draggers

Draggers need to be bottom or right aligned, in one row or one column; this alleviates dragger shifting issues.
The "task" should be seen before the possible answer options.

**Draggers bottom aligned** - graphic gap match drop bay art and the draggers will center align within the item.
     - draggers being center aligned is accomplished by correctly entering the Choices' Area Start Width.

**Draggers right aligned** - graphic gap match drop bay art will left align within the item and the draggers will be to the right of it.

Draggers should display at their 100% size. They should not get larger once pulled out of the dragger bay. They should also not shrink in size in order to fit within a drop bay.

When cloning draggers, use the maximum times a dragger can be used in the correct answer. For example, if one dragger is used 3 times in the correct answer, the number of clones for that dragger would be 3.

**For NID:** VASOL rule is to have same amount of clones as needed to answer the question.

## dates

A comma should follow the day and year in a sentence. (e.g., June 6, 1944, is D-Day.) A comma is not included between the month and year. (e.g., March 2000 was when…)

Do not include an apostrophe for centuries. (e.g., in the 1700s)

## degrees

If a text-entry box is labeled with degrees as the unit of measure, the word "degrees" should be spelled out (the symbol should not be used). For assets developed before 2016, the degree symbol is acceptable.

## diction

**EOC:** Use higher-level technical and academic diction than is used at lower grades.

## dictionary definition boxes

Definitions are placed in a text box. The tested word is boldfaced and its syllables are separated with a dot. Special characters are inserted using the ABBI character picker interface. The tested word is followed by the phonetic spelling in parentheses and lightface. The abbreviated part of speech is followed by a period, set in lightface italics, and precedes the definition(s) it applies to. Multiple parts of speech may be presented (for example, a noun and an adjective definition may appear for the same word, as long as the part of speech is specified).

Definitions are numbered with a boldface number followed by a period. Definitions begin with an uppercase letter and are followed by a period even when they are not complete sentences. Definition text is lightfaced.

There are no hard returns in the text box, with the exception of hot text TEIs. Hot text TEIs are formatted with hard returns between definitions.

If included, the etymology of the tested word appears in brackets at the end of the definition(s).

An item may ask the student to read a sentence from the passage and a dictionary entry. In such items, the sentence is set in a separate text box directly below the dictionary definition text box.

## dictionary guide words

This ELA item type should no longer be developed, however some items of this type are still currently operational. Dictionary guide words used in answer options have an open en dash between the words. (e.g., pasta – patronize; poodle – poor)

## directional words

Avoid using directional words such as "above" and "below" to direct the student to information elsewhere in the item, e.g. use "According to the information in the chart, . . ." not "According to the chart above, . . ."

- Drag the correct answer<sup>1</sup> to the box.
- Drag the correct answer<sup>1</sup> to each box.
- Drag the correct answers<sup>1</sup> to the boxes.
- Drag the answers<sup>1</sup> to the correct boxes.<sup>2</sup>
- Drag each answer to the correct location.
- Drag the answers to the correct locations.<sup>3</sup>

In these direction lines, **oval**, **notes**, **etc.** may be substituted in place of **box** or **boxes**. This will vary based on the content area and item type.

If a dragger is to be used more than once, the default would be to state this in the directions: "Each ______ (answer choice, word, term, number, etc.) may be used more than one time."

Specialized directions such as the following may also be used:

- "Drag the ___ (comma, quotation marks, punctuation marks, etc.) into the correct location within the sentence. There may be one or more correct locations."

- "Not every ____ (box, etc.) will contain a ____ (number, word, punctuation mark, an answer, etc.)."

- In Math, if the answer requires a mixed number: "Your answer must be in mixed number form."

- In Reading, for Fact/Opinion items, the direction line should read "Drag the answers to the correct boxes. Each answer may be used more than one time."

<sup>1</sup>The generic word "answer" may be replaced with a specific word if it will provide clarity.

<sup>2</sup>Use this option when draggers can be placed in any of the receptacles and the location of the answer options matters (e.g., placing words in alphabetical order or placing numbers in ascending/descending order). This is not necessary if there are limitations to dragger placement (i.e., dragger options per receptacle are in columns, and the options from a column can only be placed into one receptacle. In this scenario, the location of an option is already pre-determined within the item).

<sup>3</sup>ELA only: Use this option for Venn diagram items.

## double grid items

**Math**

**Grades 6–8:** If no figure is provided, the coordinates must be listed in the stem of the item (see VIMA127300). If the figure is provided, it may not be necessary to list the coordinates in the stem. All middle school items should have the figure's vertices clearly labeled with a capital letter. All middle school items should use the wording "integer coordinates" or "coordinates that are integers" if the coordinates are not listed in the stem (see similar items VIGM110718 and VIGM120154).

**EOC:** If no figure is provided, the coordinates must be listed in the stem of the item. If the figure is provided, it is not necessary to list the coordinates in the stem. It is okay to have figures with the vertices clearly labeled as in VIGM120154, or unlabeled as in VIGM110718. All EOC items should use the wording "integral coordinates" if the coordinates are not listed in the stem. Note that above examples use this wording.

## Earth Science terms

**Earth's solar system:** Use "our solar system" instead of "the solar system."

**Seismic waves:** Letters naming seismic waves are capitalized (e.g., P-waves, S-waves).

**Dwarf stars:** Use "dwarfs" for the plural, not "dwarves" (e.g., not "white dwarves").

## Earth/earth

**Science:** Use "Earth" when referring to the planet. Use "earth" when referring to the surface of the planet, or soil. Note that when capitalized, "Earth" does not take the article "the."

**Reading/ELA:** Do not capitalize the word "Earth" unless referring to the planet in a scientific sense. See Gregg ¶351 for more information.

## electron levels/shells

**Science:** Electron locations should be referred to as levels, not as shells.

## element names/molecules

**Science:** Differentiate the molecule from the element. [e.g., "O2" (oxygen molecule) vs. "O" (oxygen as an element)]

## ellipses

A space should separate each period in an ellipsis as well as the words preceding and following it (e.g., This sentence includes . . . an ellipsis.).

Do not include a space between an ellipsis mark and a closing quotation mark. (See Gregg ¶ 276.)

Use ellipses sparingly.

See Gregg ¶¶ 275–281 for detailed rules regarding the use of ellipses and additional punctuation.

**Reading answer options, grade 3:** Ellipses generally are not used.

Reading/ELA answer options, grades 4 and higher: Ellipses are used in options, but not in options for a stem that is written "Which phrase," "Which words," or "Which detail from the passage . . ."

Use ellipses when quoting a part of a sentence. The exception is when the partial sentence is enclosed in a text box and the introductory text states, "Read this part of a sentence. . . ." The introductory text indicates that the language in the box is only part of a sentence, so ellipses are not needed.

## em dashes

When an em dash is written mid-sentence to indicate an interruption in thought, no space is included before or after the em dash (e.g., "My friends—that is, my former friends—ganged up on me").

When an em dash ends a stem, it should be preceded by a space ("The author's intention was most likely to —").

When an em dash is used in an attribution line, it should be followed by a space (e.g., "— Thomas Jefferson").

**ELA:** An em dash is used to separate a line number and a quoted line from a passage (e.g., Line 7 — "quoted text here"). In this case, spaces are included before and after the em dash.

## emphasis treatment

The words "not" and "except" are the only words that receive emphasis treatment. They are written in boldface and all caps when emphasized.

The content specialist determines when either of these words should be emphasized. Typically, if the words "not" or "except" are being used to select the exception from the answer options, they should be emphasized. If the words are being used to set a restriction in the stem, they should not be emphasized.

Examples:

    "Which of these descriptions is NOT true about Jim?" (emphasis treatment needed)

    "When the denominator is not equal to zero . . ." (no emphasis treatment needed)

**Grade 3, all subjects except Math:** Do not use "not" questions.

**Grade 3 Math:** Occasionally uses "not" at the discretion of AS and the client, based on SOL.

en dashes

**Reading/ELA:** Ranges of more than two paragraphs, sentences, or lines should be separated by an en dash, not "through" (e.g., paragraphs 1–5).

## equations, expressions, inequalities

**Incomplete equations, expressions, and inequalities:** If the equation, expression, or inequality ends with an equal sign, it should be followed by a blank with a question mark in the blank.

An incomplete division equation should not end with an equal sign.

## evolution

**Science:** The term "evolution" may be used.

## exactly

**Math:** When lesser numbers than the correct answer are presented as options and the word "total" is not included in the stem, use the word "exactly" to ensure that lesser numbers are defensibly incorrect.

## exclusion items

New TEI items with NOT or EXCEPT in the stem will be set up as hot text in ABBI.

When created as selectable text where the student selects what is NOT included, Hot Text is the correct format to avoid TN8 student tools that could create some confusion among students.

**Layout scenarios:**

- **Bullets:** Add bullets individually to each option. The bullet will be inside the shading.
- A soft return (shift + return) can be used if separate paragraphs are not needed. (see Image1)
- A return can be used if separate paragraph spacing is needed. (see Image2)
- **NO Bullets:** If the options are complete sentences, we will not include bullets. Each sentence will be left-aligned and shaded and there will be space between each option. (see Image3)

**Note:**

*Writing Items*: traditional strikethroughs on the FTs and cores/links are being updated to the blue strikethrough spec per Amanda's 10/19/16 document. Since writing FT items have already been approved and we are not developing any new writing items this year, we aren't making any changes to NOT/EXCEPT stems in writing.

## figure labels

The language used is "Figure 1," "Figure 2," "Figure 3," etc.

Retain the capitalization of "Figure" in text when the word is used as part of a label. (e.g., "The safety equipment in Figure 1 is what a student should wear when performing a science experiment.")

## food chains and webs

**Science:** Species names in food chains and webs should be singular with headline caps.

## footnotes, copyright/trademark

One blank line of space should be placed between the end of a passage or poem and the first footnote. (Place cursor at the end of the last sentence/poem line and type return twice.)

Style the entire footnote line as `cite (legacy)`. [Note: `cite (preferred)` is only to be used for source lines in XML tables.]

Style the footnote numbers as `superscript` and `bold`.

There should be a space on either side of the en dash that separates the footnote word and the footnote definition.

Copyrights and trademarks are styled as `Copyright/Trademark` in ABBI.

<example>

Example/Pattern:

Poem/passage text, last line of last paragraph:

<sup>1</sup>footnote – footnote definition

<sup>2</sup>second footnote – second footnote definition

[Copyright/trademark goes here if applicable, styled as `Copyright/Trademark`.]

</example>

## foreign words

Foreign words or phrases that have not been established as part of the English language should be set in italics. If the word or phrase appears in the main body of the American Heritage Dictionary, it is considered established English usage and should be set it in roman (plain) font. Examples: maraca, hummus, faux pas.

If a foreign word or phrase is repeated throughout a passage, it may be set in italics on first reference and then in roman font thereafter for the sake of readability.

Departures from these guidelines may be made at the discretion of the client or assessment specialist.

## geographic references

Do not abbreviate cities, states, countries, etc. unless necessary because of space restrictions.

Do not capitalize directions (e.g., The mountains are northwest of town.), but capitalize definite regions and places (e.g., West Coast, the South).

## geometric symbols

Math: When a sentence begins with a geometric symbol, spell out the word. Otherwise, use the symbol.

Example 1: **Triangle ABC is . . .**
Example 2: **Julie measured △ ABC . . .**

## given statements in proofs

**Math:** Do not include ending punctuation if the given statement is an equation or an expression. The word "Given" and the colon following "Given" are bold.

## glossary items

**Reading, all grades:**

**Text box:** Glossary terms appear in a text box. There may be more than one term within the same box. If there is more than one term, the terms are listed alphabetically.

The tested term is boldface, lowercase, and followed by a colon that is also in boldface. The definition following the colon is lightface, initial-capped, and ends with a period (including fragments).

**Stem:** For glossary items, the stem under the text box should be specific to the item. Therefore, stems will vary in wording to fit the situation. Some examples of stems for glossary items are as follows.

- Which term best describes [character name]?
- hich sentence uses the same definition of [tested word]?
- In which sentence does the word [tested word] mean the same as it does in the glossary entry?

## historical movements

Capitalize when referring to a specific movement; lowercase when referring to a type of movement in general. Exceptions include "labor union movement" and "suffrage movement."

## inline choice

**Math and Science:** When an item includes two or more drop-down interactions, the content of one drop-down interaction should not depend on the content of another drop-down interaction. A student should be able to answer each part of the item correctly without needing to answer another part correctly.

Inline choice items must specify the number of answers. For example:

- Complete the two statements.

## internal dialogue

**Reading/ELA:** Use italics for characters' internal dialogue. This rule is to be applied only to "direct" thoughts, not to reported thoughts. In first-person fiction, addressing the reader or asking rhetorical questions is not considered internal dialogue.

Example 1: *Is this too good to be true? he wondered. Maybe I should be cautious.*
Example 2: He wondered whether it was too good to be true. Maybe he should be cautious.
Example 3: I kept thinking about the incident. How was I supposed to feel about it?

## italics, first or last word in stem

Avoid italicizing the first or last word in a stem. For scientific terminology, titles that are italicized, or other exceptions, follow the guidelines in Gregg.

## item direction lines

Item direction lines are entered as the first line of text within an item that requires them. They are formatted the same as stems (bold) with no additional line space following them.

When the content of an item (not a passage and item combination) is split into two columns, the direction line needs to be placed in its own span width of 12. This ensures the audio play button will render correctly on audio forms. (see image Directions span split item)

## keys

The word "Key" is initial-capped. Keys set under art are left-aligned.

## labels

**Math and science:** Labels in art are title-capped (also known as "headline-capped"). If a non-mathematical label appears in the art and is, therefore, uppercased (e.g., "Student 1," "Location X"), it is uppercased in the stem and answer options as well. If it doesn't appear in the art, it is lowercased (e.g., "row 7").

**Math:** Labels for mathematical entities named by one or more labeled points are lowercased (e.g., "angle *P*," "figure *WXYZ*," "line segment NU," "point *Z*"). Line labels are also lowercased (e.g., "line *m*").

Mathematical entities named by a number are uppercased (e.g., "Quadrant IV," "Figure 1").

## latitude, longitude

A space should not be used to separate a degree, an arcminute, or an arcsecond symbol from a direction label (e.g., 20°N, 155°30′09″W).

Do not use apostrophes to represent minutes and seconds. Use the prime marks in the character picker.

When using lines of longitude and latitude, include at least two north/south and two east/west lines with the direction (20°N) labeled.

**Grades 3–4:** Maps using lines of longitude and latitude to show direction should not be used.

## light

**Science, grades 5 and higher:** Use "radiant" to refer to light energy.

## maps

Only information necessary to answer the question should be included on the map.

The continental United States should not include Alaska and Hawaii. Always spell out "continental United States."

When referring to shaded areas on a map, use the terms "darker," "lighter," etc., to differentiate between shades and degrees of a color or a screen.

If the stem refers to an X on a map, the X is roman and capital but does not appear in quotation marks.

**History:** The default is to include a title with all maps. If the title would clue a correct response, the title may be omitted.

**Virginia Studies, US History I, US History II:** References in map titles should vary between "continental United States" and "contiguous United States."

## mean, median, mode

**Math, grades 4 and higher:** Use

- "mean" rather than "average" when describing or asking for the mean
- "median" when referring to the middle number in a set of data ordered least to greatest
- "mode" when referring to the number that occurs most often in a set of data

Substitutions for these terms may be made at the discretion of the assessment specialist or client.

**Science:** Always use proper USGS symbols.

## measure, measurement

In math, "measure" may be used as a noun in addition to "measurement". In other subjects, use "measurement." Any exceptions are at the discretion of the assessment specialist or client.

## money

**Math:** Whole-dollar amounts are written without the decimal and zeros and are aligned by the dollar sign.

When answer options include whole dollar amounts and dollars and cents, include a decimal and zeros to the whole dollar amounts so that the options are parallel.

Money in equations, expressions, and inequalities does not contain dollar signs.

## multiplication symbols

**Math and science, grades 3–5:** Use the multiplication symbol (×).

**Math and science, grades 6 and higher:** Use the bullet symbol (•).

Multiplication symbols should not be used before variables unless the item is an FDD (Functionality: Drag and Drop) item in which the operations are draggers that must be inserted into an equation or expression.

## names list

For any personal names not included in this list, use the spelling found in the American Heritage dictionary. Names that appear in curriculum framework should match the style in the curriculum framework, overriding a conflicting American Heritage entry.

## names, children

In informal writing, use a young child's first name only.

## names, historical figures

Use first and last names for historical figures, not last names only. When an item or passage contains multiple references to the same historical figure, second and subsequent references may use the person's last name only. Grade 3 passages use the first name on subsequent references. For Grade 4 Reading biographies, etc., refer to people by their last name instead of first.

For exceptions, see the names list.

## names, initials

One space follows an initial (e.g., John F. Kennedy; George H. W. Bush), except in the case of W.E.B. Du Bois.

## nbreak span tags

Certain combinations of text should be kept together on a line in order to improve readability and comprehension. Use a nobreak span tag to prevent the following combinations from breaking across two lines:

[Brackets in examples indicate text within span tags.]

- A social title or kinship term and a personal name: [Mr. Smith], [Aunt Sue]
- A last name and an addition such as "Jr." or "III": Martin Luther [King Jr.]
- Text and ellipses: [text . . . ], [text. . . .]
- Preceding text and an em dash, whether there is a space before the em dash (e.g., in an open-ended stem) or not.

    Example 1: the author choose that word [because —]

    Example 2: \[later—\] after we had \[rested—\] we went to the dance
- A single and a double quotation mark, which are separated by a space, plus any text that immediately precedes or follows the punctuation: [" 'I] don't mind if you do' were, I think, her exact words."
- Time and period: [12:30 a.m.], [11:30 p.m.]

- A numeral and the first word of a unit of measurement: [43 cubic] centimeters, [2 inches], [16 gal]
- A numeral and a noun that the number modifies: [12 apples]
- A numeral and the first word of a noun phrase that the number modifies: [8 Olympic] medals

Any punctuation that immediately precedes or follows text that should be kept together should also be included in the span tag.

## not to scale

The tag "not to scale" in art should be lowercase and in parentheses, with no end punctuation.

## numbers, decimals

**Math:** Include a leading zero for a decimal number greater than −1 and less than 1. (e.g., 0.5, −0.9)

## numbers, fractions

**ELA:** Fractions and mixed numbers are the same font size as other text for that grade level and are written with a diagonal as the fraction bar. (e.g., 5 1/2; 3/4)

See Gregg ¶¶ 427–428 for directions on writing fractions in passages.

**History:** Spell out fractions in stems. (e.g., one-half of a mile)

**Math:** See mathML entry in Layout

## numbers, ordinals

**All subjects:** Do not use a superscript when writing ordinals. (e.g., "4<sup>th</sup>" is correct; "4<sup>th</sup>" is incorrect.)

**Math:** Use ordinals when specifying a certain place of a number or figure in a pattern or a series. (e.g., What is the 4th number in the pattern?)

## numbers, ratios

A ratio can be written as a fraction, with a colon, or with the word *to* (e.g., "a 3-to-1 ratio"). Write all ratios in the same format throughout an item unless ratio style is being assessed. Ratios written with a colon are set with no spaces surrounding the colon (e.g., "2:4").

## numbers, remainders

Math: When presenting a remainder, include a space between the "R" and the number that follows.

## numbers, sequences

**Math, Grades 3–5:** For mathematical patterns, use a blank to indicate each element in the pattern/sequence that the student is asked to identify (e.g., "28, 45, 52, 59, 76, __, ___").

**Math, Grades 6 and up:** Use ellipses in the stem to indicate the continuation of a pattern (e.g., "1, 3, 7, 15, 31, . . .").

Items may ask for either the next element(s) or the nth element in the pattern, depending on the item specifications and assessment limits.

## numbers, spelled out

In nontechnical context, spell out whole numbers from zero through nine. Use numerals for all other numbers.

Numbers that are used in calculation or appear in lists, tables, or graphs should be presented as numerals.

Numbers that are part of a label should be presented as numerals (e.g., "Day 1," "paragraph 9"). (Note: There are some exceptions when referencing stanzas. See Language > passage/stimulus references.)

Do not start a sentence with a numeral. Recast the sentence or spell out the numeral.

If multiple numbers appear in the same paragraph or item and are used in a similar way, make them consistent. If one must be a numeral, make them all numerals. If they are used in different ways (e.g., one number used for calculation and another used idiomatically), they may be inconsistent.

When two numbers appear together, spell out the first one and use a numeral for the second one (e.g., "two 12-foot pythons"). But if the first of two numbers is a one, do not include it (e.g., "an 8-inch piece of string," not "one 8-inch piece of string").

Because of the possibility that zero could be confused with the letter O, spell out zero if it appears alone in text, without a unit of measure and not part of an expression, equation, or inequality.

These guidelines apply to both cardinal and ordinal numbers. They also apply to numbers that are used to indicate measurements of physical quantities, such as distance, length, area, volume, mass, and pressure, unless the measurement is commonly expressed in numerals (e.g., "a 40-watt bulb," "a size 14 dress," "40 miles per gallon").

See [amendments](#amendments) and [centuries](#centuries) for exceptions.

## numbers, telephone numbers

If a fictitious phone number is needed for a passage, one should be provided by the client or Pearson. "555" telephone numbers are no longer safe options.

## OK/O.K./okay

Use "OK," not "okay" or "O.K." (except in permissioned passages or quotations of previously published text).

## Oganizational terms

**Reading/ELA**

VDOE-approved terminology and styling for organizational patterns is as follows:

- cause and effect (hyphenated when used as an adjective, as in "cause-and-effect pattern")
- chronological order
- comparison/contrast
- description
- problem/solution
- sequence (grades 3–8)
- sequential (EOC)

## passages, bylines

**ELA:** Bylines for authors of permissioned passages are lightface italic and do not include the word "by." Bylines are not included for commissioned passages.

**Reading:** Bylines for passages that are based on folk tales, legends, etc., should use a byline in lightface italic, centered under the passage name. Bylines should start with "Based on" and contain no end punctuation.

Example: *Based on an East African folk tale*

## passages, excerpts

**ELA:** When a passage is an excerpt from a larger work, that information is indicated by text centered below the passage title. The text is: *from* [The Title of the Book]

## passages, intros

**Reading, grades 3–8:** Introductory text should be boxed and in bold below the passage title.

## passages, outlines

In outlines, Roman numerals and other numerals or letters are aligned on the periods.

## passages, paragraph and line numbering

**Reading/ELA:**

- Do not number the salutation, complementary closing, or signature in a letter.
- Do not number paragraphs added to introduce a selection (e.g., a paragraph that establishes the setting of a fictional passage). Do not number subheadings within selections.
- In plays, number stage directions that appear in their own paragraph.
- In functional passages (instructions, fliers, etc.), do not use paragraph numbers.
  
**Reading, grades 3–5:** Number each line in a poem.

**Reading/ELA, grades 6 and higher:** Number every fifth line in a poem.

**Writing:** Each sentence is numbered.

## passages, passage/stimulus references

**Reading, Single Passages, All Grades:**

- When referring to a passage or stimulus in general, use language that describes the genre: article, story, poem, website, flier, etc.

**Reading, Paired Passages, Grades 3–8:**

- When referring to paired passages of two different genres, use "selection" in the stem.

**ELA, Paired Passages, EOC:**

- When referring to paired passages of two different genres, refer to the genre types in the stem.

**ELA, EOC Writing:**

- Single passage: In EOC Writing, refer to research reports as "reports."

- Paired passages: When referring to paired passages of two different genres, refer to the genre types in the stem.

**Science:**

Base the names of tabs on:

- how the cluster is named (example: Student Science Project) OR

- how the graph/figure/diagram is labeled (example: Figure 1, Graph 1, Diagram 1). Use the same naming convention for the tab for graphs/figures/diagrams that would be used within the stem of the stimulus. Do not name tabs "Tab 1," "Tab 2," etc.

## passages, poems

**ELA:** Permissioned poetry should be formatted the same way it was published.

Commissioned poetry should be left-justified.

## passages, section headings

**ELA:** In a passage, there is no extra space between a section heading and the text that precedes or follows the heading.

When referring to a section heading in an item stem, set the section heading within quotation marks (e.g., "In the 'Future Implications' section..."). Avoid referencing the name of the section with the words "called" or "titled."Use the word "section" after the heading name, not before, whenever possible.

When listing headings as answer options, do not use quotation marks.

Some functional passages have section headings that are in all caps. When referring to these section headings in stems, use headline-style capitalization.

## periodic tables

When referring to a periodic table in general, use an indefinite article (i.e., "a periodic table"). When referring to a specific periodic table presented in an asset, a definite article is acceptable (i.e., "the periodic table").

Lowercase the word "group" unless referring to a specific group as in "Group 17."

When only part of a periodic table is presented, the title should be "Partial Periodic Table of the Elements."

## plane figure names

Math: Avoid using letters for plane figure names that are the same as the answer option labels (A, B, C, D, F, G, H, and J).

## plus, and

**All grades:** Don't use the word "plus" to mean "and."

• Correct: The Senate and the House constitute Congress.
• Incorrect: The Senate plus the House constitute Congress.

## point labels

Avoid using letters for point labels that are the same as the answer option labels (A, B, C, D, F, G, H, and J). Point labels are set in italic.

Also avoid using uppercase Q, T and U for point labels. Avoid letter combinations that cause inconsistent alignment on the top or bottom of a letter string.

**Grade 3:** Points are not labeled.

## points of view

**Reading/ELA:** When describing different points of view, write them as

- third person omniscient (no comma)
- first/third person omniscient (no comma)
- third person, limited to George (use comma)
- first person, George (use comma)

## prepositions

**Math:** If possible, recast to avoid ending a sentence with a preposition.

## primary sources

**History:** Retain original spellings and punctuation from primary sources as approved by Content.

When primary source text includes a word above grade level or an unusual spelling, a synonym within brackets may immediately follow the word.

## probability items

**Math:** In probability items, use "Likely, but not certain" instead of simply "Likely." Use "Unlikely, but not impossible" instead of simply "Unlikely." (Note the comma in each phrase.)

## properties

**Math:** The names of properties are not capitalized (e.g., additive identity property).

protractor items

**Math:** The degree of an angle measured with the protractor tool must be a multiple of five.

## punctuation and special characters, character picker

Character picker is a feature in ABBI that allows for the insertion of special characters that will otherwise not render properly. For example, apostrophes and quotation marks set as standard text in ABBI will render as straight vertical lines (e.g., ' and ") rather than "curly" or "smart" punctuation marks. Accordingly, use character picker rather than your keyboard for the following characters:

- En dashes (e.g., "14–16")
- Em dashes (e.g., "the bread—being a week old—was too hard")
- Opening (left) quotation marks
- Closing (right) quotation marks
- Apostrophes and single curly quotation marks
- Degree symbols
- Diacritical marks and other special characters such as those found in phonetic and foreign-language spellings

The character picker can be found in Edit mode. When selected, a pop-up containing the characters will appear. Hover over a character with your mouse to see its name.

## Punnett squares, genotypes, alleles

**Science:** Avoid using the letters C, W, J, K, and O to represent alleles, since the uppercase and lowercase versions of these letters appear similar. Preferable letters are G, R, A, and B. When using two consecutive T's or t's, add a space to separate the ligature: T T, not TT.

Letters representing alleles and genotypes are set in roman in a Punnett square, but they are set in italic in text (e.g., *B* allele, *Bb* genotype).

## question mark preceded by space

**Math:** Question marks should be preceded by a space when the preceding text is a number or would cause a ligature crash, such as when a preceding italic letter causes a crash (e.g., "triangle *ABC* ?" or "x + 4 = 10 ?").

**Science:** Insert a space before the question mark if MathML is being used and would cause a crash.

## quotation/quote

Do not use "quote" as a noun; use "quotation."

## racial/ethnic terms

Be as precise as possible when referring to racial or ethnic identity (e.g., "English settlers," not "European settlers" or "white settlers"; "the Pamunkey," not "Indigenous Peoples"; "Peruvian" or "Puerto Rican," not "Hispanic" or "Latino").

If precision cannot be achieved, broad racial terms may be needed. Lowercase the adjectives "black," "white," and "brown" and capitalize the adjective "Indigenous" when referring to racial or ethnic identity by these broad terms.

Capitalize "People" or "Peoples" as well in "Indigenous People" or "Indigenous Peoples" when referring to a specific group or groups (e.g., "the Indigenous Peoples of Canada"), but use lowercase "people" when describing persons who are Indigenous (e.g., "the authors were all Indigenous people but belonged to different nations").

Use the noun "Indigenous People" or the adjective "Indigenous" instead of "American Indian" or "Native American."

Use "African American" (unhyphenated as both noun and adjective) instead of "black" except in some historical contexts (see below). Avoid using "brown" unless necessary for context (e.g., when quoting original text or referencing a political cartoon that uses this term). Use a more precise term if possible. If "black" and "brown" must be used, avoid using them as nouns (e.g., use "black people," not "blacks") unless quoting original text or in the case of the historical term "free blacks."

Other racial terms constructed with "American" are also unhyphenated, whether in noun or adjective form, unless the first term is a prefix (e.g., "Asian American" vs. "Anglo-American").

If "black," "white," or "brown" appear uppercased in previously published text (permissioned or public domain), allow them to remain uppercased. If "Indigenous" appears lowercased in previously published text (permissioned or public domain), notify the permissions coordinator assigned to the program, who will confirm whether it is permissible to uppercase the term.

Note, however, that racial terms in previously published text should not, in general, be changed (e.g., do not change "black" to "African American"). Use of original terms is often necessary in order to achieve authenticity and factual accuracy in social studies. However, some outdated terms may be considered inappropriate for lower grade levels or offensive (e.g., "colored," "Negro," "mulatto"). If a potentially inappropriate or offensive term appears in previously published text, it may be possible to redact the term and/or replace it with another term in brackets. Notify the permissions coordinator assigned to the program, who will confirm whether redaction and/or replacement is permissible.

Depending on context, audience, and grade level, it may be acceptable to use preferred terms in answer choices that reference historical texts with non-preferred terms. These word choices should be made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of an assessment specialist.

## ranges for paragraphs, sentences, lines

**ELA:** Ranges of only two paragraphs, sentences, or lines should be separated by "and" (e.g., sentences 15 and 16). Ranges of more than two paragraphs, sentences, or lines should be separated by an en dash, not "through" (e.g., paragraphs 1–5).

## readers/the reader

**Reading/ELA:** Use "the reader" instead of "readers" in stems and answer options.

## reference resources

**Computer/technology dictionary:** *Random House Webster's Computer & Internet Dictionary*, Third Edition (1999)

**Dictionary:** *The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language*, Fourth Edition (2000)

**Style:** *The Gregg Reference Manual*, Tenth Edition (2005)

## remainders

**Math:** When remainders are in options, leave a space between the "R" and the number that follows.

## rules and statements

**Math:**

**Complete sentences:** Rules that are complete sentences should start with an uppercase letter and end with a period. Do not place complete sentences in quotation marks.

**Fragments or incomplete sentences:** Rules that are not complete sentences should start with a lowercase letter and have no end punctuation. Place these rules in quotation marks. Rules that start with a variable should be treated as incomplete sentences.

## second-person narration

**Grades 3–8:** Avoid using second-person voice and contractions in informational, research, or functional passages. Fictional narratives and literary memoirs may use contractions, especially if dialogue is included. Exceptions to this guideline may be exercised at VDOE discretion.

EOC: Use higher-level technical and academic diction than is used at lower grades.

## ships and other vessels

The names of ships and other vessels are both capitalized and italicized. (e.g., the *Lusitania*; *Phoenix Mars lander*; *HMS Frolic*; the *Spirit of St. Louis*; *USS SC-530*)

## solar system models

**Science:** Art pieces depicting models of a solar system need to include the tag "(not to scale)" below and to the right of the art.

## source lines

A source line, or acknowledgement, should be applied to a graphic (e.g., table, graph, map, diagram) when proprietary information or intellectual property is used to create the graphic. The source line should begin with "Source:" and end with a period. It should be right-aligned under the graphic.

**History:** Include a source line for text or data in a graph or table that is from a single source. If the source is from a website, do not use the website address. Instead, use the name of the company, agency, entity, etc.

## species

**Science, grade 5:** Whenever possible, use species native to Virginia and Virginia biomes in stimuli.

## states of matter

States of matter are set in-line in italics (not subscript), in parentheses, with no space preceding [e.g., Na(*s*), CO(*g*), H₂O(*l*), MgCl₂(*aq*)].

## stem layout

Stems are bold.

No additional line spaces between or after lines in a stem except:

- after a table element.
- after box text styled as Box Text Multi, a soft return should be added if additional stem text follows the box text.

## stem language, Writing

**Writing, grades 8 and higher:**

Two ways to write stem language are

- In sentence X, how is Xxxxxx Xxxxx correctly written?
- In sentence X, how is Xxxxxx Xxxxx best written?

The second stem is used in special instances in which more than one answer could be considered correct, but only one answer is written best.

## stem-and-leaf plots

**Math:** The number in the key should not have repeating digits. The key should not be a stem/leaf combination in the plot. The default for stem and leaves is to have them ascending and ordered.

## stems, titles, captions, headers

All stems, titles (including passage, art, and graphic titles), section headers, table column headers, and captions are boldfaced.

Note: Boldface treatment must be applied manually in ABBI. TN8 and IFFC do not automatically apply the treatment.

## syllabication items

For syllabication items, use an en dash between syllables. There should be no spaces on either side of the en dash.

Example: il–lus–tra–tion

## tables and charts

Titles are required on all charts and tables unless the titles present clueing issues.

**Reading:** In items, do not refer to a graphic as a "table." Refer to all tables as "charts."

## tables and graphs, units of measurement

Do not use "in" in table headers and axis labels. [e.g., "Length (feet)" rather than "Length (in feet)"]

## table text alignment

Table titles use style `title`. They are centered and bold above the table in their own paragraph element.

Headers are centered and bold.

Headers in horizontal tables are left aligned.

An 8 pixel padding is on cells that have left justification or require more space between the table border and text. This is added manually in the source code. See XML section.

Content alignment within table cells is as follows:

| <font color="#FOC807">Alignment</font> | <font color="#FOC807">Content</font> |
| -------- | ------- |
| **Centered**| Individual numbers and single alpha characters |
| **Left Justified or Centered, Depending on Content** | Single words |
| **Left Justified** | Single or multiple lines of text, number sets in stem/leaf plots |

## taxonomy, binomial nomenclature

The word "kingdom" should be lowercase before or after the actual kingdom name. (e.g., "kingdom Animalia" or "Animalia kingdom")

Genus and species names are both italicized. The genus name is capitalized; the species name is lowercase. (e.g., *Rosa caroliniana*, *Styrax californica*, *Natrix natrix*)

## temperatures

**Celsius, Fahrenheit:** No space is between the number and degree symbol or the degree symbol and the unit of measurement. (e.g., 32°C/85°F)

**Kelvins:** No degree symbol is included when writing degrees in kelvins. Include a space between the number and the unit of measurement. (e.g., 200 K)

**Science:** Temperatures should be measured in SI units (e.g., kelvins or degrees Celsius).

## tested words and phrases, emphasis treatment

**Reading/ELA passages:** Tested words should not be underlined. However, during development, potential vocabulary words may be underlined. Prior to committee, this underlining will be removed by AS.

**Reading/ELA items, underlining:**

If an item tests the meaning of a word or phrase, underline the tested vocabulary word or phrase anywhere it appears in the item—in the stem, in boxed text, and in the answer choices. This rule does not apply to text boxes in syllabication, dictionary, or thesaurus items.

Example: Which of these is a synonym for *unruly* as it is used in paragraph 9?

In prefix and suffix items, underline only the prefix or suffix—whether it appears in isolation or as part of the tested word—in both the stem (including boxed text) and the answer options.

Example: In paragraph 5, what does the prefix *re-* in the word *reappear* mean?

**Reading/ELA items, quotation marks**

If an item assesses figurative language or the impact of a word or phrase and not its literal meaning, do not use underlining. Instead, treat the tested word or phrase as a quotation from the passage and enclose it in quotation marks in the stem.

Examples:

- In line 21, what does the phrase "stood at attention" convey about the trees?
- How does the author's choice of the word "supposedly" affect the tone of the article?

**ER Grade 8 and EOC Writing:** Tested words in passages will be underlined. However, do not underline tested words in a Writing editing section.

## text-entry items

**Math and science:** This TEI type should not be used when answer choices contain or result in a repeating decimal.

**All subjects:** Spaces should not be allowed in any text-entry items.

## theorems and postulates

Theorems and postulates are capitalized. (e.g., Side-Side-Side, Side-Angle-Side)

## theories and principles

**Science:** Proper names are capitalized when included in the name of a theory or principle. (e.g., Newton's first law)

## thermal/heat

**Science, grades 5 and 8:** Use "thermal" as an adjective instead of "heat" when referring to energy. (e.g., thermal energy; heat transfer)

## thesaurus entry boxes

This style applies to both static and interactive thesaurus items.

Thesaurus entries are placed in a text box. The tested word is boldfaced. The entry may include one part of speech or multiple parts of speech.

**One part of speech:**

The part of speech is abbreviated, set in lightface italics, and followed by a period. An em dash surrounded by spaces separates the part of speech from the first synonym. Synonyms should be in alphabetical order. All synonyms are lowercase and separated from one another by commas. A period follows the final synonym.

**Multiple parts of speech:**

Each part of speech is abbreviated, set in lightface italics, and followed by a period. The part of speech precedes the thesaurus synonym(s) it applies to.

An item may ask the student to read a sentence from the passage and a thesaurus entry. In this case, the sentence from the passage is set in a separate text box directly above the thesaurus entry text box.

TEIs with hot text should be formatted with hard returns between entries.

## trademarked names

Avoid using trademarked names (e.g., Kleenex, Windows, Popsicle, Dumpster, Styrofoam, Plexiglas/Plexiglass). Replace with generic terms when possible.

When a trademarked name must be used (e.g., when the content is about a specific brand), an unregistered trademark symbol (™) or a registered trademark symbol (®) should not be used. According to the *Chicago Manual of Style*, "there is no legal requirement to use these symbols, and they should be omitted wherever possible."

**ELA and Reading:** When trademarked names are used in a passage or standalone item, include the following disclaimer at the end of the passage or item: "Trademarks owned by third parties may be included as part of the text in these testing materials. Such trademarks are owned by the respective trademark holders, none of which are affiliated with Pearson or VDOE, nor do these owners endorse or otherwise sponsor or approve these materials."

## URLs, websites

Do not underline website URLs.

All URLs should include "www". Do not include "http:" or "https:". (Note that URLs in permissions and credit lines should be set as stipulated by the rights holder.)

Avoid using real URLs unless permission has been acquired from the rights holder. All fictional URLs should contain a caret (^) to ensure that they do not represent a real website.

Examples:

`www.chamber^of^commerce.org`

`www.^happytrailsadventures.com`

## utilize, use

  Don't use the word "utilize" to mean "use."

• Correct: The builders used power tools to construct the shelter.

• Incorrect: The builders utilized power tools to construct the shelter.

## variables

**Math:** Variables are lowercase and italic. The following variables are preferred: *m*, *n*, *p*, *q*, *r*, *u*, *v*, *w*, *x*, and *y*. If possible, avoid variables that can be confused with answer option labels or numbers: *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *f*, *g*, *h*, *j*, *i*, *o*, *s*.

For assets developed before 2016, *s* variables will be replaced with *y*, *m*, or *n*.

## Venn diagram

**Reading/ELA only, all grades:**

Do not use the term "Venn diagram." The stem should read "Complete this diagram" or some variation thereof.

When a Venn diagram is part of a graphic gap match (drag-and-drop), the direction line will be "Drag the answers to the correct locations."

Titles above the diagram are optional, but labels are necessary within the left and right sections of the diagram itself. Labels should be in bold font. Do not label the middle section "both."

**Grade 3 Reading only:**

A Venn diagram will always be referred to as a "chart."

## which of the following/which of these

Do not use "which of the following" in stems. Use "which of these" instead.

## word alternatives

Do not use parentheses to create word alternatives—for example, "a(n)" or "bag(s)."

---
